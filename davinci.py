        "segment": "Joel Klebler  \nThanks for joining me Lottie. So, with Lottie O'Dea, who's from Satellite Foundation and one of the offices here in North Melbourne. Thanks for doing this. We've had Rose on, from Satellite, before. If anyone listens to this podcast will know, I think it's a fantastic organization. Would have helped me a lot as a kid so I think it's important to get more people from Satellite like yourself, just talking about what you're doing and the great work you're doing, how people get involved, and all that sort of stuff. Your title here is Evidence and Insight Lead and Youth Advisor for Satellite Foundation, but you're also a participant in the programs as well. Maybe you want to start talking about how you got involved in Satellite in the first place.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, absolutely. I grew up in New Zealand, which might already be obvious from my accent. Yeah, that's where all my family and lived experience of having a parent with mental illness occurred. About five years ago, I moved over to Australia. My mum was hospitalized at that time. I was feeling really kind of isolated and lonely in that experience and I started looking around at different organizations that help people in my position. I came across some but they were really for parents that had children with mental issues. Then, I found Satellite, and I was like, Oh, wow, these are my people. I joined the 2019 young leaders' program, met some other people in my position, and met Satellite, and the wonderful people there. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nIt was a huge surprise, a year later or maybe six months later, they gave me a call. They remembered me, which was a new experience for me in mental health land. They said, Hey, we've got another program going on. How about you come join us? I did that and then eventually started talking about what I do in my professional life and yeah, my personal and professional lives combined and so yeah, now I get to work as Youth Advisor, which is really finding opportunities for our young people to speak more about what they want to see in the world, including at Satellite, so what they want Satellite to look like. Then, Evidence and Insights, which is more around...we know\u2014well, we think we're doing really great stuff with young people but we need to be able to translate that into something that government can understand or philanthropists can understand, as well. They're two quite different roles but I love them both. They're great.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nNow, let's talk about your lived experience, then. You mentioned you've got a parent with mental illness, and you said something about being forgotten about, which I think a lot of people can relate to. Maybe I'll talk about your experience with mental illness itself and maybe go into more about your experiences about being forgotten or why you feel that way? \n\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, so my mum has delusional disorder, which, from my level of understanding of different mental health diagnoses, is fairly similar to schizophrenia but she doesn't have hallucinations around noise or visuals. But she does definitely experience delusions and just psychotic episodes and just really distress. She's had that probably long before I was born. She was not diagnosed. I have an older mum, she was born in the 1940s; and so I was a little surprise in her 40s. Yeah, so she was about 46 when she had me; wasn't in a great relationship with my dad, which just kind of exacerbated all these things that had probably been under the surface for a very long time.",

Being under New Zealand, they're called the Compulsory Treatment Acts. I think there's similar concepts here in Australia. Yeah, it just was under that. Then, doctors kind of got sick of this person just turning up and said, Oh, look, she's probably fine. She's a very articulate person. She puts her clothes together well. I think people saw that and said, A person with mental issues can't look like that so she's probably fine. They would take off the Compulsory Treatment Act and then what we came to realize was the cycle began again, of her deciding that she's not sick, she doesn't need the medication. A few months later, the delusions begin again in small ways, build up to really big ways; become a harm to herself or to other people, and particularly me, as a child in that situation. Yeah, cycle starting again.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI can relate to everything you said because it's very similar to mine. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nYou said you were eight when you sort of first started realizing or you can sort of remember what was going on. What were you thinking around that sort of time? Or do you remember sort of the feelings? Or what was happening? Or how did it change your perspective, I guess?\n\nJoel Klebler  \nOne thing you said, which I think most people want to hear, my mom was the same. Presented really well, had really nice clothes, and looked like she had it all together and stuff like that...but yeah, well, it's a way to hide it.",

        "segment": " \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. Well, I think the thing that I felt and I feel like other people with similar experiences feel: you don't really realize  that it's not normal for a while. Things like my mother thinking she's being followed all the time. My role in the car would be to write down the number plates of all the cars that were following us. Then, going in a car ride with some friends and kind of wondering why they don't have to note down the number plates of the other cars. Or yeah, my mom talking to me about quite intense things relating to sex or pregnancy at quite a young age, because she thought I could be pregnant to this man that she had delusions about and was jealous of all women, including her own daughter about... Just, I guess, having those experiences assuming that they're what you should be doing, because it's your mum and you love and trust her and that's what she's there for, and then kind of observing other families where that didn't quite happen, and yeah, kind of slowly connecting the dots. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nThen, a big event like a hospitalization occurred, where\u2014I do have older brothers and sisters but they're much older than me, so decades age difference\u2014where they would then try to broach the subject with me, but I think it was hard because I felt really protective of my mum. It was just me, my mum, and my dog. We were this little triad that were fiercely predictive of one another and so, even against my own siblings, I was like, I don't want you to take my mum away from me, even though she's doing these things that really scare me.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI think it's a very\u2014well, people watching this who have similar experiences, it's a very common thing what you just said then. Yeah, that perspective thing's hard because as you said, that's your normal, right? Your normal is this and you love your mom or your dad and you don't know any different. But, as you said, you start piecing it together when you might go to a friend's house or something. You just sort start working out, Well, maybe my situation's not as normal. How did you deal with that, growing up in regards to how you framed it to yourself? Or was it just something that you loved just your mom so much, you just didn't worry about it? Or how did you deal with that?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in part, I was a little bit scared of the alternative as well. My mom separated from my dad. I was really nervous about being removed from my mom's custody and going into my dad's custody. I did not want that and so, I was afraid that\u2014wanting to love and protect my mum, but I was also afraid if someone finds out what's going on, I'm going to be taken away from my mum and that's scary for me. I guess I sort of appointed myself as the role of, I know my mum best. I know what she needs, from a really young age. I was worried if I was taken away from her, she would also get worse.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nHow did you deal with the hospitalization offer? Were you taking into see her? Or how was the process like in New Zealand?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. I mean, I guess my brothers and sisters were doing all that kind of behind-the-scenes work that, as I've gotten older, I kind of understand what they would have been doing in terms of getting her signed up as an involuntary patient because my mum will always be an involuntary patient. I didn't really find out about it until kind of the last minute or that's my recollection of it anyway. They did take me in to see Mum. I do remember my brother at one point asking me if I could pack a bag for my mum and I remember just walking into her wardrobe and just being like, No I can't do this. It was just way too much for me to do and it just really made me feel sad and feel like I was in a position I felt like no one else at my age was in and I just felt extremely alone in that moment, despite the support of my siblings. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, I have a really distinct memory of being in the psych ward in Wellington, in New Zealand, and everything just been stark white, and seeing a room. It was glass and it had some frosting, so you could only see partly into it. I could see my mum on the other side of the room keeping all together, sitting up putting a face on, but also looking just terrified in her eyes. I remember seeing the person sitting across from her, who was just this bald man within it... I just remember the light hitting his head. I don't know, it just seemed really strange seeing my mum in this incredibly sterile environment where, I guess in my mind at that age, was where bad people go. That just really sticks with me, seeing someone that I love so much, and was such a comfort to me being sent to this sterile and scary looking environment.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nDid anyone explain much to you when the first time happened? Because I remember as well, it's a very scary experience, as you said, and you just don't understand that these places exist. Now, did you meet the psychologists there? Was anyone there, like a nurse, the mental health nurse to explain things to you? Or were you provided any, let's say, context or any sort of caring guides anyway?",

        "segment": "\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nNot that I remember. I'm confident my siblings would have probably been in that role and as I got older, I was definitely never really given\u2014sorry, older, but still under the age of 18\u2014I was never given that respect, basically, by the mental health professionals. I think they saw not telling me information as protecting me but really, it just completely disempowered me, because I was essentially on the front lines. I was her full-time carer, I was the one constantly looking out for...if someone looked at her in a weird way, I was the one on the lookout to calm her down, cheer her up so she didn't develop a delusion out of that situation. Being kept in the dark by the mental health profession just amplified how lonely I felt and the fact that I was just making everything up as I was going. I had no idea what was really going on.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nPlenty relate to what you said then. I think the key phrase is lack of respect. Yeah, I sort of think...well, I don't think they're trying to protect us. I just think they just don't want\u2014me personally, I just think they don't want...  I've got enough to deal with. I've got children or hard work, or whatever, but you what you said is the key, it's we're the frontline, whereas you're in the home with your mother. You're the emotional support, and you're the carer, and you know that person better, regardless of whether you're eight years old, six years old, or 25 years old. You know that person better. You're right, you need to be treated with respect, because you will be more mature and you will have an understanding of a far more intense concept than other kids your age. I think even now\u2014I don't know what your opinion now is. Could be you deal with a lot of kids now, so probably you're better than me. I don't know how much it's changed, but do you think it is productive? Or what would you advise if there's a parent in a mental health psychiatric ward? How should you involve the children? Or what would you think would be the most appropriate way to do it?",

    {
        "segment": "\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI actually think just treating the child as the expert in the situation and not seeing them as someone that needs to be informed of something. I think treating them as, So, what do you think's going on? What do you think makes mum or dad or whoever feel this way? Kind of just treating that child as a peer because in that situation, they have the depth of knowledge of that person or of that illness. Maybe they don't have the right medical jargon but I feel like all these kids with all these mental health nurses that don't have the qualification, but we've got this yeah, depth of emotional experience. Instead of telling them something, ask them. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI feel like that's useful not just for making the child feel safe but it's actually a huge information source for the mental health professionals as well, in terms of understanding even just basic concepts. Things like financial instability is a huge trigger for my mom's episodes, many children's situations. In many of these situations, the kids end up becoming not just the carer, but also the accountant of the household, as well. I think the professionals understanding that perspective is also really helpful and empowers the young person, and makes them feel safe so that if you did want to inform them of something, like a diagnosis or give them knowledge, then you've built a kind of trust with that young person to do that. But I completely take your point, having that and investing in that kind of conversation takes time. Sometimes those professionals don't have it or don't want to invest it.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI was gonna say, from dealing with a lot of young people you do now, what do you hear from them in regards to how they're being treated? Is there a lack of respect still or are they being involved more? What are you hearing?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in a clinical setting, they're certainly still experiencing the same level of disrespect. I haven't heard really examples of how that's changed. I guess, at a societal level, I feel like there's a bit of a chipping away at some of that. Phrases like, I guess, carer, in relation to mental illness...that was not a conversation that was happening in New Zealand, at least up until the time I left about five years ago, whereas I feel like it is here. If you say the phrase young carer, maybe people don't fully understand the wide breadth that that could cover but there's some foundational level of understanding that that could be. I feel like there's probably more respect coming from society to these young people than there is from in a medical or clinical setting to these young people, but I don't think either is enough.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I agree. I think the clinical setting...it's annoying to hear that because you just think\u2014this is not everyone, but it would be a common issue. I mean, you'd think\u2014as you said, what would have helped you, is just being acknowledged and just being spoken to the same as what they might have been speaking to your siblings, if they were. Just to be in the room and just to be spoken to at the same, regardless if you're eight years old or you're listening or not, because that memory will really stick with you. When you get a bit older, you think, They actually care and they've treated me with a bit of respect, and I understand a bit more. Whereas, even to now you're saying, I felt a lack of respect. Right? That sticks with you, doesn't it?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOh, definitely. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nExact same thing with me. That's why, for me personally, it puts you off the mental health professional psychologist or psychiatrist. In general, I've got a really bad distain towards them, just because of that way I was treated in my younger years. Whereas you, you've gone the other way where you've gone and worked in that field, whereas...\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI'm mean, kind of. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhere you're involved in that. You're involved not in clinical, but in the mental health profession in some way. I think, a lot of people who have had our experiences, who would be completely put off and they might not get the help they need to deal with PTSD or to deal with all these sorts of things, because of that one bad experience. So, just from that lack of come in the room and just talk to me... I think it's a five-minute 10-minute thing but the impact could be huge.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, I agree. In fact, I think it's probably led to me being quite in mental health land, but in a non-clinical way. I think I probably wouldn't be able to be a doctor anyway but I think, yeah, that kind of experience has put me off those kinds of things, or that kind of career path anyway. I guess, I see Satellite as really the antidote to that kind of treatment, though, because we're a place where kids or young people and young adults as well can come in, and they can kind of set the agenda, including just things like what activities you want to do, or we have a lot of creative stuff. Whenever we have creative work, they can take that where they want to take it. That, to me, is kind of just the antidote to that opposite approach of, You will do this or we just won't even talk to you. Yeah, and it's quite amazing to see in Satellite environments, because you don't even need to talk about mental health a lot of the time, or you don't need to talk about diagnosis or what's going on at home. You can just let them be and that is actually sadly groundbreaking for a lot of young people\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, because you've got everyone there's got an understanding, everyone's there for the similar reason and they know that. As you said, when you were younger, you felt so isolated. Whereas, if you had something like this when you're younger, just that isolation immediately goes. You don't feel lonely. You go, Right, cool. It's not, it's not just me as an isolated issue, there's a whole bunch of other people going through the same thing. You feel instantly better about yourself, or better self-esteem, and all that sort of stuff.",

What are you finding out with the programs and how it's helping people?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, so Satellite covers a really wide range of ages, which I think is fantastic. We go all the way down to that eight-year-old stage, and then all the way up to 25 but also over 25. When I first started as a participant at Satellite, I think I was 27. They're attitude is, all the services or the or the funding related to services can be really cut and dry about certain age ranges for supports but that's not how mental illness works. It doesn't go, Oh, you're 25. Okay, cool, all your issues or challenges are solved. We are really open for people on either end of that spectrum, to be part of our programs. We then kind of section up age ranges between that. So, roughly the eight to 12, then the of 13 to 17, and then the 18 to 25 pluses. That's kind of typically how programs are grouped up. I can't remember your other question.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nNo, I think that's important, because you sort of know\u2014you've maybe started, you've half got an idea what's certainly going on. But as you said, up to 25, or even beyond that, whereas people might be so put off by the experiences at a young age, and might not seek out anyone until let's say, 27 or 25? Right? Me, probably it was 30, 31, because I've had such a bad experience as a young person. Whereas you're right, I think that open age, it's not just a cutoff point where you're all sorted, it's a lifelong thing, unfortunately. You're going to have to keep dealing with things.",

        "segment": " \n\nJoel Klebler  \nThe other thing I was going to ask you about was the identification process. Is there something with a school? Or how do these kids get nominated into it? Or many parents even nominate these people into the program?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, so in short, it's a big mix. We get referrals through the families with parents with mental illness, which in short term, would affect me. We get referrals through that process, referrals through programs like MacKillop Family Services, but we do get parents referring in their kids. Which to be honest, just warms my heart so much, that there are parents out there going, I have this thing, or my partner has this thing or my ex partner, whatever. That's not something to be shameful or guilty about but it is something that means maybe my kid needs a bit of additional support, or just an opportunity to have fun with other young kids that are in a similar situation. And so, we do receive parental referrals and they're really open about it. I've had the opportunity to speak to some of the parents, and it's just incredible talking with them. Yet, as a person that didn't have something like Satellite in their lives, yeah, it just warms your heart being like, Wow, there are parents like that out in the world that are incredibly brave and courageous to do that. Yeah, it's just fun to work with them.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhat about schools? Do you match from schools? Because I think the schools, being the teachers, they would know a bit about the kid's situation as well.  For me, I sort of think if the teachers could have awareness around this is the thing in Victoria or whatever, it makes it easier for them to refer, as well. I don't think they've had a lot of options going before. You would have known as well that schools wouldn't have had any idea of what to do.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nNo. In fact, I distinctly remember a teacher... Because my mom was having a lot of issues, I pulled a lot of sickies at school, to be at home with my mum, but obviously that had an impact on her able to earn an income. She's a single mum. I distinctly remember a teacher pulling me into a cupboard and just yelling at me saying that I was faking being sick and all this stuff and that that was making it worse for my mom. Yeah so, when you say they're not particularly informed about what's going on, that kind of episode really hits home to me; that not only were they just simply not there to provide appropriate support, in fact, they went the other way and really did not assist me at all. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in short, no, we don't receive that many referrals through schools. We want them and we're working on getting more in a couple of different ways. One is that Satellite's getting more into delivering programs in schools and working alongside schools to figure out what would actually be helpful. We've tried things like targeted programs where young people that has parents or family members with mental illness are recommended to satellite to create a program. But now we're also working on programs that are wider, so imagine your class assembly or home class sort of approach where everyone gets that kind of education, because there's lots of things with the cohort that we talk about that are also just relevant for other people. Caring is not something that has to only happen when someone has a mental illness, there's plenty of transferable skills, and just being a good person from those kinds of programs.",

The Victorian government's invested more into mental health supports within schools, primary and secondary, which is really exciting. They've also got things like the mental health menu, where they're giving funding to schools, to choose off the menu of supports related to mental health and wellbeing. There's a procurement process related to that, but we're wanting to get on that menu with some of our programs. So, we're working in a few different ways to get into schools more but yeah, it's going to be a little bit of give and take, to some extent. There's only so much we can do until there is awareness, a) that mental health is important in that, b) that mental health belongs in schools, and see that it's not just when a young person themselves has a mental illness or faces a mental health challenge, but that if other people in their lives have that going on, that that young person deserves support and can access it. We exist.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nAbsolutely. Let's talk about the school part because I think it's important because there's a lot of kids who will go to school and have all this stuff going on at home and then act normal at school, which you obviously know. What do you think would have helped you from a school's perspective? Because, there's a fine line. You don't want to use it\u2014as a kid, you could use it as an excuse to have bad behavior and you get away with things, then all of a sudden...it's not a good behavior to have, but also, you do need some sort of understanding or some sort of help to try and acknowledge that that's going on, rather than trying to treat you the same as everyone else. What do you think would have helped you from a school perspective?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nWell, I actually did have a really great experience at my school. A couple of reasons why it might have been a really good experience\u2014and this is back in New Zealand\u2014is that it was a private school. It was a boarding school as well, which gave me a bit of distance from my family, which I have to say was life-changing. Having that, essentially, respite from my mum during some of those years.

It's the few months before it. It was just getting way, way too much. I can't remember why but at some point, me and a group of friends ended up in the staff room and I saw that they had a whiteboard. On it they had things saying like, So-and-so's parents are separating, or Give someone so-and-so a bit more space or slack in the classroom, kind of thing. I was like, Oh wow, there's a way to communicate to my teachers that I've got other stuff going on, and so I approached someone about what was going on for me, because it had always been very much on shutdown.

They put it on this whiteboard and I had a couple of different responses from staff. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOne was my English teacher, he came up to me...I think it must be the day after it was put up on the board...and he said, Hey, we don't have to have a big conversation about this or anything but I just wanted you to know, my dad suffered from alcoholism, and it was a big deal but it hasn't determined the kind of person that I would be. Then, he kind of just let me be. We didn't have to have a big heart out or anything, he was just, I wanted you to know that. I thought that was just really nice. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nThe second incident was my principal came up to me and she said, Wow, this is very serious. Shouldn't we be letting your father know? My heart kind of just dropped to the floor because I was terrified it because I've been keeping us completely quiet from not just my dad, but my whole dad's side of my family. That if my dad found out, he would get custody of me, he would take me out of my school. I knew that my education in the school I was at was very good for me in my life and so, I was just instantly terrified, like, What have I done? Why have I shared this? I've screwed everything up. Then I kind of said to her, No, I really would like you not to, please. That would be very bad for my situation. She trusted me and she said, Okay, I trust what you say. I'll follow your guidance on this. It was a real moment of, Oh, my God, this could go so, so wrong for me and my family, to then an incredible moment where an adult was trusting me as a technical child, but yeah, she respected me, which was a complete difference to the experiences that I was just talking about before, so it was a very emotional roller coaster for me in those few seconds.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nThat's great to hear that from a school's perspective. I don't think it'd be overly common, but it's really good to hear that your school was like that, because as you said, you remember it now, it sticks with you, and all that sort of stuff. It's absolutely fantastic. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhat I'm going to say to you now, is you stayed on a really good path. Obviously, you studied hard. Where did you get that? Because you can go the two ways, I reckon. You can either use it as an excuse to go, I'm going to be bad or whatever, I'm going to do this and then blame this. Whereas, you've gone the other way where you've gone and worked really hard, studied, and all that sort of stuff. Was it a conscious decision you made? Or was it just naturally?

She, for all of my siblings and I, really pushed hard on education, and so part of it definitely came from that but I guess as well as once I got into a very fancy school with incredible other students and teachers around me, it kind of really dawned on me like, Wow, this is the key to unlock lots of other things as well. I guess...I think sometimes, yeah, you can say people not use it as an excuse, but it can get too much and get in the way of pursuing other things. If anything, I think I swung too hard in the other direction and kind of clung to education and being a perfect A-plus student kind of person, that I had neglected the other parts of my life. It was just, Pull it together, be a trooper, get good grades, get out of here. Whereas, I wish I had taken the time to be like, How am I going? How's my mental health? How's my emotional health?

Was it something where you involved\u2014obviously, education was important, so you would study a lot, which would probably take your mind off a lot of things. It's a very stressful environment, it can be sometimes, especially, as you said before, the period when you know they're really sick or they're about to get unwell and it may be involuntary, but you can't do anything about it. How did you deal with that time? What do you think about that period between that unwell period? I've heard a few opinions on it like people go, Well, the person under the Act...if someone doesn't want help, they can't really get forced to get help, or whatever, but saying that, you've still got kids involved or who they're responsible for. Where does the priority lie? Does the priority lie with the person with the illness or the kids who are in their care? What's the balance between it? Maybe you want to talk a little bit about what are your thoughts on that?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. I mean, I think that problem, I think, is really a system-created problem. When you're in a family where someone has a mental illness and they don't acknowledge it, or in my mom's case, it is part of her illness, she has Anosognosia, I think is the right word for it, where she is incapable of having insight into her own mental illness.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nMine was exactly the same, yeah. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nSo many in the schizophrenia world are but the system's not built for it because the wide range of mental illnesses,  schizophrenia or particularly those more complex ones, they make up a minority but I think the impact that those illnesses and challenges bring about...yes, they're in the minority, but the depth of impact and the impact on people around them is so huge. I think because the system is built, ironically, with the assumption that people are working rationally in it, but applying that to a mental health system, I think is just bizarre. They assume that if someone is unwell, a) they'll recognize they're unwell, b) they'll recognize they need support, and c) they'll figure out a way to go get it. I just think that the fundamental idea behind it is wrong for a lot of people, and then you add in something like lack of insight.",

Two is to make them an involuntary patient, or put them under something like the Compulsory Treatment Order. We don't want to do that. You are sacrificing someone's human rights to do that and it is extremely serious but it's literally the only tool in our toolbox. And so, I think when you asked that question, where should the priority be? I think it needs to be on both but I think at the moment, because the only tool in our toolbox is this one extreme measure, that's all we can use. It's actually really hard to get access to it, which makes sense, because it's so serious, but there's nothing else for us to use.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, you're right. The reason why I asked that question is I posted something. I think it was someone who maybe had bipolar schizophrenia, had a cracked back and he's saying, Well, it's not up to me...there's all these laws. I'm sort of thinking, Well, when there's a child or when there's young people involved and their responsible for a primary caregiver...because then, it's got to sort of shift a bit. The annoying thing is, is that we know that person better than anyone else. Growing up my situation is we knew my mom was getting unwell. We'd call my uncle, Oh, you just got to let her get sick, Joel until she gets the cops or the ambulance. It shouldn't be like that. You got a four-week, three-week period, where it's highly risky. Why can't we call the caseworker or someone to come around and check in on it? You're right, they don't have insight into themselves and a lot of the time, they don't think they've got a mental illness, so they don't have nothing wrong with them.

The reality\u2014if someone's watching this or listening in regards to how it works is the person gets so unwell generally, where either the police are called or the ambulance is called, and then they're taken to the emergency room with everyone else. There we've got broken arms or whatever else, and then I've got to do a psych or mental health assessment, even though they've got extensive history. Then, if there's a bed available or not, then they've got to then take them to the...it's a really\u2014the process is wrong,\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOh, it's completely wrong. I guess I'm excited to see, in the Royal Commission, that they're wanting to change those things, but the cynic in me is kind of waiting for\u2014particularly in the complex mental health space\u2014for it to kind of revert to the norm. I'm not holding my breath for there to be more tools made available for people or families in that situation but I'm really excited to be proven wrong but I'm cautiously optimistic about that those developments.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI think for us it's, you know three to four weeks out or whatever the timeframe it is, you know this person's about to go over the edge, and you had no recourse and you're just told, Oh you've just go do it. Then you've got to deal with that stuff. If you're doing exams, or you're trying to do something, or you can't get to your practice or whatever, because you can't drive at that age or whatever and it's just like you know...you want the help, but you can't get it. That's the reality of it. You're right, hopefully, something changes but that's just Victoria alone, it's not the rest of Australia. I don't know, what would you think would help in that situation? That three to four-week period, what would you think\u2014let's say a young person, or a carer or whatever, what could they do to help or what should be the scenario?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI mean, I think in that environment, that is really weird. The caseworker or the social worker really can come into their own, because they are the people that have the skills, the connections to services to do things like, not necessarily always doing a formal psych assessment, but they know the things that they need to be looking for. That is when I feel like we should be able to call on the professional services to come in. Yeah, maybe they're still not at the kind of hospitalization stage, but the thing is we want to avoid the hospitalization stage. I feel like there's things that people in those roles can help with. So, even if it's things that aren't directly around the mental illness, like financial stability, like\u2014I don't know, travel, for the kids to school\u2014things that can just lessen some of the other pressures that then kick off the mental illness as well. I think even doing things like that can massively help the person going through the distress, but definitely the family as well. Then, I think there just needs to be access to treatment and services that for people in that stage of their mental illness, because like I said, we don't want them to get to the hospital stage, that's awful.

However, with bipolar schizophrenia, and delusional...these are still words that charities or people don't like using or even I don't think understand as mental health. They will think they understand everything in mental health but as we know, there's a lot more towards that. What more do you think can be done for young people in the community to de-stigmatize those conditions? We know from\u2014I think it's a Bipolar, Australia report, that I think it's 43% of people who committed suicide in 2018, 2019 had bipolar disorder, for example, and then schizophrenia was another 10%. You got more than half of the unfortunate people choosing their in life in Australia, we have two conditions yet, I don't think we know that. What should be done to help destigmatize those two conditions and your mother's conditions? What can be done? What do you think?\n\nLottie O'Dea \nFor me, what I would love to see is, for example, the young people at Satellite just being everywhere. Them sharing their stories, them being invited to share their stories...because that's the best way to understand what those illnesses look like in practice, it's to talk with young people to hear, Yeah, it's really tough but also, this is still my mom at the end of the day, and I love her and there's a million great things about her. I think it's really easy for us to point at someone and be like, Oh, they're schizophrenic, and that equals bad mother. Whereas that's not the case. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think also, I would love to see more conversations where there's people that have gone through, or are still on their journey with their own mental health challenges, and be talking with people that are in the families of those with mental health challenges, because I feel like sometimes the consumer and the carer conversations happen in parallel, and it's kind of like we're never allowed to meet because, God forbid, we disagree with one another. But I think it's really important that we disagree with one another, especially when it comes to things like involuntary treatment. We should be having a debate about it. You can't come to understand a lot of those tricky and complex concepts or feelings until you hear them from people. I think it's really, you can't really get past just that awareness raising that... You know those old shirts that were like, This is what a feminist looks like? It's kind of like, This is what a young person that has a parent with bipolar looks like, and there's a huge range. Yeah, I think we have to get over that hump before we can get anywhere else.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nNow, with the programs in satellite, you use a lot of creative outlets. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah. Do you want to talk more about why you do the programs a certain way you're doing them? Or what do you find that helps?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nWell, it's funny that you say that because I remember looking at Satellite when I was thinking about joining as a participant, and then also in the program that I started in and looking at all this creative stuff, and me going, I'm not a creative person.

Yeah, I'm thinking exactly the same.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI was pretty skeptical coming in, but I was like, Whatever, I'll give it a shot. How bad could this go? Really, I think the magic of the creative work is that it means a) you don't have to talk about mental health directly, which, particularly in the younger age groups, it's just not appropriate to. They've already been in lots of deep and meaningful and very serious conversations about this. We don't need to approach it from that view and in fact, it's not really helpful, but the creative activities that we do, they can be about mental health but in terms of, What, am I good at? What superhero would I be if I was a superhero? Yeah, recognizing their strengths and building their own mental resilience, but not necessarily in sitting them down and being like, Okay, so can you give me a list of your top five strengths and weaknesses, and then, show it? I guess, helping them to identify what's going well for them and their own mental well being, but also helping them to identify other things that are going on in their lives as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nAs well as the fact that when you're doing something creative, you're kind of doing it shoulder-to-shoulder with another person, and because of Satellite, it will always be another younger person that has at least one thing in common with you. We see it's really that peer connection that opens people up to those bigger and sometimes heavier conversations as well, but creativity is kind of that gateway to letting those conversations happen. I'm a convert and now, as a facilitator, I'm actually leading some of the creative activities. I've come from my skeptical, scaredness of being a non-creative to recognizing there's a real reason why it works and makes people feel comfortable. It gives them various outlets to communicate whatever they want to communicate. It also just lets people try new things. I think when you've been through traumatic time or just a long standing challenge, sometimes you just move into that Trooper mode where you're like, I just need to get this done. I need to get Mom well. I need to look after Mom. The freedom and the privilege of trying new things is not always something that's there and so this kind of space exists to help with that and that helps you feel good as a person.

What we don't have as many numbers on or evidence on is what the kind of outcomes are for young people when they do something like Satellite. That's a gap that we've got at the moment but it's also something that we're wanting to fill. That's why I have the role that I have and I'm supporting Satellite to measure its impact and to communicate its impact. We do things like we bring on universities, such as Monash, to support us in our evaluation of our activities, how we can get better. That sort of evaluation is actually directed by our Youth Advisory Council as well. When we measure our impact, we want it to be useful for talking with government, but we don't want it to be fully driven by their outcome. We bring in our young people to tell us, This is what was meaningful to me, say, peer connection, realizing I'm not all alone. We go, Great. You're the expert in this situation. Then we get researchers and so on to figure out we useful ways to measure things like social connection.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI was going to say\u2014because it's always hard, you've always got to measure some of them.

        "segment": " \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, sometimes. I mean, there's been really amazing work in the justice space, in relation to that kind of concept you're talking about. Imagine one person or two people or no, the same person in parallel universes. They are doing that kind of work in justice, for example. If one, let's say, a young person does a does a burglary, and one gets rehabilitative justice, and one gets kind of the typical juvie sort of approach, how does that sort of change their life? Pathways? But I think, partly, it's easier to do that in justice in a way, because there's fairly easy outcomes or bad outcomes to avoid, to look for. Whereas in our space, a) mental health still has that stigma around it. Not that justice doesn't, but I guess we're competing against the fact that, for example, as an under 18-year-old, I never would have been identified as a person that could go to Satellite because my mum would immediately take that away. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nBut also, that we rely quite strongly on the clinical outcomes at the moment to understand the experiences that young people have with this kind of experience. You'll hear phrases like, Young people that have parents or carers with mental illness are twice as likely to have their own mental health challenges. We agree that that's a really important thing but for us, it's also like, That is true, but they are also fiercely resilient people. We would much rather kind of get a sense of how does that experience, as a child in that situation or a young person, make you resilient, prepare you for other challenges that will come along in your life? And then, how does something like Satellite build on that resilience? How does it build a sense of community with other people? Which I guess in short, is having a more strengths based approach to it. The hard part about that is it's harder to measure and it's newer. It's easier to measure when someone's had a hospitalization and then the cost of hospitalization. It's harder to measure the change in resilience for a person and also the kind of monetized benefit of changing someone's resilience.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I remember chatting to Addy, who is another person of Satellite, and same thing. I was trying to work out\u2014we know logically, this is a positive thing, right? I understand you have to show stuff for governments and stuff, they throw money at anything now these days without much stuff, but it's annoying because we know how much it would have helped and we know the impact. You know, firsthand, the impact it has.  Just trying to demonstrate that as a study or with numbers, or however you need to do it is very frustrating, because you can almost just have the stories of the kids or the young people who've done it who just talk about it then, in front of a room of politicians, or whoever was doing the funding. To me, personally, that's the evidence you need but it's just really hard, because I kind of stand from your point of view, how hard it must be to try and put that on paper, and how do you actually do that? Whereas, you know\u2014everyone probably logically knows that it's doing all this stuff. Whereas, to say that for the bureaucrats who have appealed on the funding or whatever, it just seems like it's a very tough challenge that you've got to do.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nIt is. I guess I've seen the other side of it, though, because I've worked within government and trained as an economist, as well so I guess I've seen their perspective. In terms of, you've got a research and development into child cancer, you've got programs like Satellite, but you've also got things like social housing, and all of those things can be preventative policy and they're all kind of competing against one another.

I'm totally fine with that but I'm fine with it because I guess I know how it's used. It's not about the individual dollars and cents. It's more about demonstrating, Hey, if you do help a young person in this situation, you're helping them in that moment. You're helping them for the rest of their lives, so you help with their resilience. That's good in their immediate short term for getting through what they need to get through, but it can also help with the other challenges that come up in their lives. Now actually, Satellite's at a point where some of the earliest people that went through their programs, they're kind of either in or at the cusp of parenthood themselves, some of them and so, I think now is when we'll start to see some of that generational change as well, where we can help break the cycle. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I think that's important because yeah, as a cost from the economy, like if you have someone who can be a better parent than maybe what they were, just makes everything, as you know. It just, as you said, breaks the cycle and it makes life a lot easier for a lot of people.

The fact that someone like Rose could see this, a literal decade in advance of what feels like everyone else. She saw that this was an issue, she saw that more support was needed, and she made it happen.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI think it's amazing. I think yeah, for someone to be so passionate about this, where they're just passionate about that issue, and to put all that 10 years of work into something, with no expectation of any return, but to know that you're actually doing something. Whereas a lot of people say that and whatever it is, she's gone and done it and now to get that rewarded...\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nExactly. It doesn't always happen. There's lots of people out there that do amazing things and don't get that recognition or funding, so it's\u2014yeah, it's incredible to be in that position where both of those things have occurred. Yeah, in terms of going forward, it's really exciting times. We're, in short, expanding the programs that we have, so not just doing more of what we've done before, but we're doing new things as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nWe've always done a couple of regional workshops, because being out in the regions is extremely important to Satellite. We know that the quality and consistency of services can really drop off when you leave metropolitan areas. Now we're doing things like planning a regional roadshow, where we can consistently make our way around particular areas of Victoria to begin with, but we've got a plan for world domination. Then, we're also broadening the kind of things that we can offer as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nFor that sort of 18 to 25, we've always had this thing we call Youth Pathways, which is you can come in to Satellite sometimes to engage with things in relation to your situation, in relation to mental health, but through Youth Pathways, you can also come in to give back in some way or to upskill in other ways. We have things in relation to things like public speaking, in relation to thinking about your career, including things\u2014in fact, you came to one of our workshops in relation to careers or thinking about how you might want to draw on your lived experience and in what you do, and the different shapes that that can take. We've had that in some shape or form but now what we're doing is broadening that to a younger age group as well, with fun activities that are really flexible, and we make them work for the people that come across that Satellite.",

To things like finding opportunities for them to share their story or advocate for what they think should happen in the system, to linking them to opportunities to be trained in peer work, for example. It's a really exciting time for us to do more, but also for us to link to the other developments that are happening in the mental health sector, but also into other sectors, like the creative sector as well and just create those linkages for our young people and then just watch them grab it with both hands and move forward.

One is just to Google Satellite Foundation and you'll come across our website. We're also pretty active on Facebook and on Instagram, as well. On that, you can kind of get a sense of who we are what we do, and really, if you've still got questions, whether you're a parent, a carer, a young person, or maybe a professional working in this kind of space, the best thing to do is really slick as an email, get on the phone with us. We've grown, we've got plans for world domination, but we've still got that heart of the small organization and we're really good at making programs flexible to what people need. The best way for us to do that is to let us know what's on your mind. Learn a bit more about us, we'll learn a bit more about you, and then we can really do some cool stuff together.",

We've had Rose on, from Satellite, before. If anyone listens to this podcast will know, I think it's a fantastic organization. Would have helped me a lot as a kid so I think it's important to get more people from Satellite like yourself, just talking about what you're doing and the great work you're doing, how people get involved, and all that sort of stuff. Your title here is Evidence and Insight Lead and Youth Advisor for Satellite Foundation, but you're also a participant in the programs as well. Maybe you want to start talking about how you got involved in Satellite in the first place.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, absolutely. I grew up in New Zealand, which might already be obvious from my accent. Yeah, that's where all my family and lived experience of having a parent with mental illness occurred. About five years ago, I moved over to Australia. My mum was hospitalized at that time. I was feeling really kind of isolated and lonely in that experience and I started looking around at different organizations that help people in my position. I came across some but they were really for parents that had children with mental issues. Then, I found Satellite, and I was like, Oh, wow, these are my people. I joined the 2019 young leaders' program, met some other people in my position, and met Satellite, and the wonderful people there. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nIt was a huge surprise, a year later or maybe six months later, they gave me a call. They remembered me, which was a new experience for me in mental health land. They said, Hey, we've got another program going on. How about you come join us? I did that and then eventually started talking about what I do in my professional life and yeah, my personal and professional lives combined and so yeah, now I get to work as Youth Advisor, which is really finding opportunities for our young people to speak more about what they want to see in the world, including at Satellite, so what they want Satellite to look like. Then, Evidence and Insights, which is more around...we know\u2014well, we think we're doing really great stuff with young people but we need to be able to translate that into something that government can understand or philanthropists can understand, as well. They're two quite different roles but I love them both. They're great.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nNow, let's talk about your lived experience, then. You mentioned you've got a parent with mental illness, and you said something about being forgotten about, which I think a lot of people can relate to. Maybe I'll talk about your experience with mental illness itself and maybe go into more about your experiences about being forgotten or why you feel that way? \n\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, so my mum has delusional disorder, which, from my level of understanding of different mental health diagnoses, is fairly similar to schizophrenia but she doesn't have hallucinations around noise or visuals. But she does definitely experience delusions and just psychotic episodes and just really distress. She's had that probably long before I was born. She was not diagnosed. I have an older mum, she was born in the 1940s; and so I was a little surprise in her 40s. Yeah, so she was about 46 when she had me; wasn't in a great relationship with my dad, which just kind of exacerbated all these things that had probably been under the surface for a very long time.",

Being under New Zealand, they're called the Compulsory Treatment Acts. I think there's similar concepts here in Australia. Yeah, it just was under that. Then, doctors kind of got sick of this person just turning up and said, Oh, look, she's probably fine. She's a very articulate person. She puts her clothes together well. I think people saw that and said, A person with mental issues can't look like that so she's probably fine. They would take off the Compulsory Treatment Act and then what we came to realize was the cycle began again, of her deciding that she's not sick, she doesn't need the medication. A few months later, the delusions begin again in small ways, build up to really big ways; become a harm to herself or to other people, and particularly me, as a child in that situation. Yeah, cycle starting again.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI can relate to everything you said because it's very similar to mine. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nYou said you were eight when you sort of first started realizing or you can sort of remember what was going on.

        "segment": " \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. Well, I think the thing that I felt and I feel like other people with similar experiences feel: you don't really realize  that it's not normal for a while. Things like my mother thinking she's being followed all the time. My role in the car would be to write down the number plates of all the cars that were following us. Then, going in a car ride with some friends and kind of wondering why they don't have to note down the number plates of the other cars. Or yeah, my mom talking to me about quite intense things relating to sex or pregnancy at quite a young age, because she thought I could be pregnant to this man that she had delusions about and was jealous of all women, including her own daughter about... Just, I guess, having those experiences assuming that they're what you should be doing, because it's your mum and you love and trust her and that's what she's there for, and then kind of observing other families where that didn't quite happen, and yeah, kind of slowly connecting the dots. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nThen, a big event like a hospitalization occurred, where\u2014I do have older brothers and sisters but they're much older than me, so decades age difference\u2014where they would then try to broach the subject with me, but I think it was hard because I felt really protective of my mum. It was just me, my mum, and my dog. We were this little triad that were fiercely predictive of one another and so, even against my own siblings, I was like, I don't want you to take my mum away from me, even though she's doing these things that really scare me.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI think it's a very\u2014well, people watching this who have similar experiences, it's a very common thing what you just said then. Yeah, that perspective thing's hard because as you said, that's your normal, right? Your normal is this and you love your mom or your dad and you don't know any different. But, as you said, you start piecing it together when you might go to a friend's house or something. You just sort start working out, Well, maybe my situation's not as normal. How did you deal with that, growing up in regards to how you framed it to yourself? Or was it just something that you loved just your mom so much, you just didn't worry about it? Or how did you deal with that?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in part, I was a little bit scared of the alternative as well. My mom separated from my dad. I was really nervous about being removed from my mom's custody and going into my dad's custody. I did not want that and so, I was afraid that\u2014wanting to love and protect my mum, but I was also afraid if someone finds out what's going on, I'm going to be taken away from my mum and that's scary for me. I guess I sort of appointed myself as the role of, I know my mum best. I know what she needs, from a really young age. I was worried if I was taken away from her, she would also get worse.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nHow did you deal with the hospitalization offer? Were you taking into see her? Or how was the process like in New Zealand?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. I mean, I guess my brothers and sisters were doing all that kind of behind-the-scenes work that, as I've gotten older, I kind of understand what they would have been doing in terms of getting her signed up as an involuntary patient because my mum will always be an involuntary patient. I didn't really find out about it until kind of the last minute or that's my recollection of it anyway. They did take me in to see Mum. I do remember my brother at one point asking me if I could pack a bag for my mum and I remember just walking into her wardrobe and just being like, No I can't do this. It was just way too much for me to do and it just really made me feel sad and feel like I was in a position I felt like no one else at my age was in and I just felt extremely alone in that moment, despite the support of my siblings. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, I have a really distinct memory of being in the psych ward in Wellington, in New Zealand, and everything just been stark white, and seeing a room. It was glass and it had some frosting, so you could only see partly into it. I could see my mum on the other side of the room keeping all together, sitting up putting a face on, but also looking just terrified in her eyes. I remember seeing the person sitting across from her, who was just this bald man within it... I just remember the light hitting his head. I don't know, it just seemed really strange seeing my mum in this incredibly sterile environment where, I guess in my mind at that age, was where bad people go. That just really sticks with me, seeing someone that I love so much, and was such a comfort to me being sent to this sterile and scary looking environment.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nDid anyone explain much to you when the first time happened? Because I remember as well, it's a very scary experience, as you said, and you just don't understand that these places exist. Now, did you meet the psychologists there? Was anyone there, like a nurse, the mental health nurse to explain things to you? Or were you provided any, let's say, context or any sort of caring guides anyway?",

I'm confident my siblings would have probably been in that role and as I got older, I was definitely never really given\u2014sorry, older, but still under the age of 18\u2014I was never given that respect, basically, by the mental health professionals. I think they saw not telling me information as protecting me but really, it just completely disempowered me, because I was essentially on the front lines. I was her full-time carer, I was the one constantly looking out for...if someone looked at her in a weird way, I was the one on the lookout to calm her down, cheer her up so she didn't develop a delusion out of that situation. Being kept in the dark by the mental health profession just amplified how lonely I felt and the fact that I was just making everything up as I was going. I had no idea what was really going on.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nPlenty relate to what you said then. I think the key phrase is lack of respect. Yeah, I sort of think...well, I don't think they're trying to protect us. I just think they just don't want\u2014me personally, I just think they don't want...  I've got enough to deal with. I've got children or hard work, or whatever, but you what you said is the key, it's we're the frontline, whereas you're in the home with your mother. You're the emotional support, and you're the carer, and you know that person better, regardless of whether you're eight years old, six years old, or 25 years old. You know that person better. You're right, you need to be treated with respect, because you will be more mature and you will have an understanding of a far more intense concept than other kids your age. I think even now\u2014I don't know what your opinion now is. Could be you deal with a lot of kids now, so probably you're better than me. I don't know how much it's changed, but do you think it is productive? Or what would you advise if there's a parent in a mental health psychiatric ward? How should you involve the children?

    {
        "segment": "\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI actually think just treating the child as the expert in the situation and not seeing them as someone that needs to be informed of something. I think treating them as, So, what do you think's going on? What do you think makes mum or dad or whoever feel this way? Kind of just treating that child as a peer because in that situation, they have the depth of knowledge of that person or of that illness. Maybe they don't have the right medical jargon but I feel like all these kids with all these mental health nurses that don't have the qualification, but we've got this yeah, depth of emotional experience. Instead of telling them something, ask them. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI feel like that's useful not just for making the child feel safe but it's actually a huge information source for the mental health professionals as well, in terms of understanding even just basic concepts. Things like financial instability is a huge trigger for my mom's episodes, many children's situations. In many of these situations, the kids end up becoming not just the carer, but also the accountant of the household, as well. I think the professionals understanding that perspective is also really helpful and empowers the young person, and makes them feel safe so that if you did want to inform them of something, like a diagnosis or give them knowledge, then you've built a kind of trust with that young person to do that. But I completely take your point, having that and investing in that kind of conversation takes time. Sometimes those professionals don't have it or don't want to invest it.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI was gonna say, from dealing with a lot of young people you do now, what do you hear from them in regards to how they're being treated? Is there a lack of respect still or are they being involved more? What are you hearing?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in a clinical setting, they're certainly still experiencing the same level of disrespect. I haven't heard really examples of how that's changed. I guess, at a societal level, I feel like there's a bit of a chipping away at some of that. Phrases like, I guess, carer, in relation to mental illness...that was not a conversation that was happening in New Zealand, at least up until the time I left about five years ago, whereas I feel like it is here. If you say the phrase young carer, maybe people don't fully understand the wide breadth that that could cover but there's some foundational level of understanding that that could be. I feel like there's probably more respect coming from society to these young people than there is from in a medical or clinical setting to these young people, but I don't think either is enough.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I agree. I think the clinical setting...it's annoying to hear that because you just think\u2014this is not everyone, but it would be a common issue. I mean, you'd think\u2014as you said, what would have helped you, is just being acknowledged and just being spoken to the same as what they might have been speaking to your siblings, if they were. Just to be in the room and just to be spoken to at the same, regardless if you're eight years old or you're listening or not, because that memory will really stick with you. When you get a bit older, you think, They actually care and they've treated me with a bit of respect, and I understand a bit more. Whereas, even to now you're saying, I felt a lack of respect. Right? That sticks with you, doesn't it?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOh, definitely. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nExact same thing with me. That's why, for me personally, it puts you off the mental health professional psychologist or psychiatrist. In general, I've got a really bad distain towards them, just because of that way I was treated in my younger years. Whereas you, you've gone the other way where you've gone and worked in that field, whereas...\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI'm mean, kind of. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhere you're involved in that. You're involved not in clinical, but in the mental health profession in some way. I think, a lot of people who have had our experiences, who would be completely put off and they might not get the help they need to deal with PTSD or to deal with all these sorts of things, because of that one bad experience. So, just from that lack of come in the room and just talk to me... I think it's a five-minute 10-minute thing but the impact could be huge.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, I agree. In fact, I think it's probably led to me being quite in mental health land, but in a non-clinical way. I think I probably wouldn't be able to be a doctor anyway but I think, yeah, that kind of experience has put me off those kinds of things, or that kind of career path anyway. I guess, I see Satellite as really the antidote to that kind of treatment, though, because we're a place where kids or young people and young adults as well can come in, and they can kind of set the agenda, including just things like what activities you want to do, or we have a lot of creative stuff. Whenever we have creative work, they can take that where they want to take it. That, to me, is kind of just the antidote to that opposite approach of, You will do this or we just won't even talk to you. Yeah, and it's quite amazing to see in Satellite environments, because you don't even need to talk about mental health a lot of the time, or you don't need to talk about diagnosis or what's going on at home. You can just let them be and that is actually sadly groundbreaking for a lot of young people\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, because you've got everyone there's got an understanding, everyone's there for the similar reason and they know that. As you said, when you were younger, you felt so isolated. Whereas, if you had something like this when you're younger, just that isolation immediately goes. You don't feel lonely. You go, Right, cool. It's not, it's not just me as an isolated issue, there's a whole bunch of other people going through the same thing. You feel instantly better about yourself, or better self-esteem, and all that sort of stuff.",

What are you finding out with the programs and how it's helping people?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, so Satellite covers a really wide range of ages, which I think is fantastic. We go all the way down to that eight-year-old stage, and then all the way up to 25 but also over 25. When I first started as a participant at Satellite, I think I was 27. They're attitude is, all the services or the or the funding related to services can be really cut and dry about certain age ranges for supports but that's not how mental illness works. It doesn't go, Oh, you're 25. Okay, cool, all your issues or challenges are solved. We are really open for people on either end of that spectrum, to be part of our programs. We then kind of section up age ranges between that. So, roughly the eight to 12, then the of 13 to 17, and then the 18 to 25 pluses. That's kind of typically how programs are grouped up. I can't remember your other question.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nNo, I think that's important, because you sort of know\u2014you've maybe started, you've half got an idea what's certainly going on. But as you said, up to 25, or even beyond that, whereas people might be so put off by the experiences at a young age, and might not seek out anyone until let's say, 27 or 25? Right? Me, probably it was 30, 31, because I've had such a bad experience as a young person.

We get referrals through the families with parents with mental illness, which in short term, would affect me. We get referrals through that process, referrals through programs like MacKillop Family Services, but we do get parents referring in their kids. Which to be honest, just warms my heart so much, that there are parents out there going, I have this thing, or my partner has this thing or my ex partner, whatever. That's not something to be shameful or guilty about but it is something that means maybe my kid needs a bit of additional support, or just an opportunity to have fun with other young kids that are in a similar situation. And so, we do receive parental referrals and they're really open about it. I've had the opportunity to speak to some of the parents, and it's just incredible talking with them. Yet, as a person that didn't have something like Satellite in their lives, yeah, it just warms your heart being like, Wow, there are parents like that out in the world that are incredibly brave and courageous to do that. Yeah, it's just fun to work with them.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhat about schools? Do you match from schools? Because I think the schools, being the teachers, they would know a bit about the kid's situation as well.  For me, I sort of think if the teachers could have awareness around this is the thing in Victoria or whatever, it makes it easier for them to refer, as well. I don't think they've had a lot of options going before. You would have known as well that schools wouldn't have had any idea of what to do.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nNo. In fact, I distinctly remember a teacher... Because my mom was having a lot of issues, I pulled a lot of sickies at school, to be at home with my mum, but obviously that had an impact on her able to earn an income. She's a single mum. I distinctly remember a teacher pulling me into a cupboard and just yelling at me saying that I was faking being sick and all this stuff and that that was making it worse for my mom. Yeah so, when you say they're not particularly informed about what's going on, that kind of episode really hits home to me; that not only were they just simply not there to provide appropriate support, in fact, they went the other way and really did not assist me at all. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think in short, no, we don't receive that many referrals through schools. We want them and we're working on getting more in a couple of different ways. One is that Satellite's getting more into delivering programs in schools and working alongside schools to figure out what would actually be helpful. We've tried things like targeted programs where young people that has parents or family members with mental illness are recommended to satellite to create a program. But now we're also working on programs that are wider, so imagine your class assembly or home class sort of approach where everyone gets that kind of education, because there's lots of things with the cohort that we talk about that are also just relevant for other people. Caring is not something that has to only happen when someone has a mental illness, there's plenty of transferable skills, and just being a good person from those kinds of programs.",

The Victorian government's invested more into mental health supports within schools, primary and secondary, which is really exciting. They've also got things like the mental health menu, where they're giving funding to schools, to choose off the menu of supports related to mental health and wellbeing. There's a procurement process related to that, but we're wanting to get on that menu with some of our programs. So, we're working in a few different ways to get into schools more but yeah, it's going to be a little bit of give and take, to some extent. There's only so much we can do until there is awareness, a) that mental health is important in that, b) that mental health belongs in schools, and see that it's not just when a young person themselves has a mental illness or faces a mental health challenge, but that if other people in their lives have that going on, that that young person deserves support and can access it. We exist.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nAbsolutely. Let's talk about the school part because I think it's important because there's a lot of kids who will go to school and have all this stuff going on at home and then act normal at school, which you obviously know. What do you think would have helped you from a school's perspective? Because, there's a fine line. You don't want to use it\u2014as a kid, you could use it as an excuse to have bad behavior and you get away with things, then all of a sudden...it's not a good behavior to have, but also, you do need some sort of understanding or some sort of help to try and acknowledge that that's going on, rather than trying to treat you the same as everyone else. What do you think would have helped you from a school perspective?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nWell, I actually did have a really great experience at my school. A couple of reasons why it might have been a really good experience\u2014and this is back in New Zealand\u2014is that it was a private school. It was a boarding school as well, which gave me a bit of distance from my family, which I have to say was life-changing. Having that, essentially, respite from my mum during some of those years.

Then, at some point, I was doing that and mum was not in hospital, but on the way there, basically, which I think is the hardest time. Once they're in hospital, it becomes a bit easier, to be honest. It's the few months before it. It was just getting way, way too much. I can't remember why but at some point, me and a group of friends ended up in the staff room and I saw that they had a whiteboard. On it they had things saying like, So-and-so's parents are separating, or Give someone so-and-so a bit more space or slack in the classroom, kind of thing. I was like, Oh wow, there's a way to communicate to my teachers that I've got other stuff going on, and so I approached someone about what was going on for me, because it had always been very much on shutdown. I didn't want really anyone to know, apart from my friends. They put it on this whiteboard and I had a couple of different responses from staff. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOne was my English teacher, he came up to me...I think it must be the day after it was put up on the board...and he said, Hey, we don't have to have a big conversation about this or anything but I just wanted you to know, my dad suffered from alcoholism, and it was a big deal but it hasn't determined the kind of person that I would be. Then, he kind of just let me be. We didn't have to have a big heart out or anything, he was just, I wanted you to know that. I thought that was just really nice. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nThe second incident was my principal came up to me and she said, Wow, this is very serious. Shouldn't we be letting your father know? My heart kind of just dropped to the floor because I was terrified it because I've been keeping us completely quiet from not just my dad, but my whole dad's side of my family. That if my dad found out, he would get custody of me, he would take me out of my school. I knew that my education in the school I was at was very good for me in my life and so, I was just instantly terrified, like, What have I done? Why have I shared this? I've screwed everything up. Then I kind of said to her, No, I really would like you not to, please. That would be very bad for my situation. She trusted me and she said, Okay, I trust what you say. I'll follow your guidance on this. It was a real moment of, Oh, my God, this could go so, so wrong for me and my family, to then an incredible moment where an adult was trusting me as a technical child, but yeah, she respected me, which was a complete difference to the experiences that I was just talking about before, so it was a very emotional roller coaster for me in those few seconds.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nThat's great to hear that from a school's perspective. I don't think it'd be overly common, but it's really good to hear that your school was like that, because as you said, you remember it now, it sticks with you, and all that sort of stuff. It's absolutely fantastic. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nWhat I'm going to say to you now, is you stayed on a really good path. Obviously, you studied hard. Where did you get that? Because you can go the two ways, I reckon. You can either use it as an excuse to go, I'm going to be bad or whatever, I'm going to do this and then blame this. Whereas, you've gone the other way where you've gone and worked really hard, studied, and all that sort of stuff. Was it a conscious decision you made? Or was it just naturally?

She, for all of my siblings and I, really pushed hard on education, and so part of it definitely came from that but I guess as well as once I got into a very fancy school with incredible other students and teachers around me, it kind of really dawned on me like, Wow, this is the key to unlock lots of other things as well. I guess...I think sometimes, yeah, you can say people not use it as an excuse, but it can get too much and get in the way of pursuing other things. If anything, I think I swung too hard in the other direction and kind of clung to education and being a perfect A-plus student kind of person, that I had neglected the other parts of my life. It was just, Pull it together, be a trooper, get good grades, get out of here. Whereas, I wish I had taken the time to be like, How am I going? How's my mental health? How's my emotional health?

Was it something where you involved\u2014obviously, education was important, so you would study a lot, which would probably take your mind off a lot of things. It's a very stressful environment, it can be sometimes, especially, as you said before, the period when you know they're really sick or they're about to get unwell and it may be involuntary, but you can't do anything about it. How did you deal with that time? What do you think about that period between that unwell period? I've heard a few opinions on it like people go, Well, the person under the Act...if someone doesn't want help, they can't really get forced to get help, or whatever, but saying that, you've still got kids involved or who they're responsible for. Where does the priority lie? Does the priority lie with the person with the illness or the kids who are in their care? What's the balance between it? Maybe you want to talk a little bit about what are your thoughts on that?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah. I mean, I think that problem, I think, is really a system-created problem. When you're in a family where someone has a mental illness and they don't acknowledge it, or in my mom's case, it is part of her illness, she has Anosognosia, I think is the right word for it, where she is incapable of having insight into her own mental illness.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nMine was exactly the same, yeah. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nSo many in the schizophrenia world are but the system's not built for it because the wide range of mental illnesses,  schizophrenia or particularly those more complex ones, they make up a minority but I think the impact that those illnesses and challenges bring about...yes, they're in the minority, but the depth of impact and the impact on people around them is so huge. I think because the system is built, ironically, with the assumption that people are working rationally in it, but applying that to a mental health system, I think is just bizarre. They assume that if someone is unwell, a) they'll recognize they're unwell, b) they'll recognize they need support, and c) they'll figure out a way to go get it. I just think that the fundamental idea behind it is wrong for a lot of people, and then you add in something like lack of insight.",

Two is to make them an involuntary patient, or put them under something like the Compulsory Treatment Order. We don't want to do that. You are sacrificing someone's human rights to do that and it is extremely serious but it's literally the only tool in our toolbox. And so, I think when you asked that question, where should the priority be? I think it needs to be on both but I think at the moment, because the only tool in our toolbox is this one extreme measure, that's all we can use. It's actually really hard to get access to it, which makes sense, because it's so serious, but there's nothing else for us to use.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, you're right. The reason why I asked that question is I posted something. I think it was someone who maybe had bipolar schizophrenia, had a cracked back and he's saying, Well, it's not up to me...there's all these laws. I'm sort of thinking, Well, when there's a child or when there's young people involved and their responsible for a primary caregiver...because then, it's got to sort of shift a bit. The annoying thing is, is that we know that person better than anyone else. Growing up my situation is we knew my mom was getting unwell. We'd call my uncle, Oh, you just got to let her get sick, Joel until she gets the cops or the ambulance. It shouldn't be like that. You got a four-week, three-week period, where it's highly risky. Why can't we call the caseworker or someone to come around and check in on it? You're right, they don't have insight into themselves and a lot of the time, they don't think they've got a mental illness, so they don't have nothing wrong with them.

The reality\u2014if someone's watching this or listening in regards to how it works is the person gets so unwell generally, where either the police are called or the ambulance is called, and then they're taken to the emergency room with everyone else. There we've got broken arms or whatever else, and then I've got to do a psych or mental health assessment, even though they've got extensive history. Then, if there's a bed available or not, then they've got to then take them to the...it's a really\u2014the process is wrong,\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nOh, it's completely wrong. I guess I'm excited to see, in the Royal Commission, that they're wanting to change those things, but the cynic in me is kind of waiting for\u2014particularly in the complex mental health space\u2014for it to kind of revert to the norm. I'm not holding my breath for there to be more tools made available for people or families in that situation but I'm really excited to be proven wrong but I'm cautiously optimistic about that those developments.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nI think for us it's, you know three to four weeks out or whatever the timeframe it is, you know this person's about to go over the edge, and you had no recourse and you're just told, Oh you've just go do it. Then you've got to deal with that stuff. If you're doing exams, or you're trying to do something, or you can't get to your practice or whatever, because you can't drive at that age or whatever and it's just like you know...you want the help, but you can't get it. That's the reality of it. You're right, hopefully, something changes but that's just Victoria alone, it's not the rest of Australia. I don't know, what would you think would help in that situation? That three to four-week period, what would you think\u2014let's say a young person, or a carer or whatever, what could they do to help or what should be the scenario?\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI mean, I think in that environment, that is really weird. The caseworker or the social worker really can come into their own, because they are the people that have the skills, the connections to services to do things like, not necessarily always doing a formal psych assessment, but they know the things that they need to be looking for. That is when I feel like we should be able to call on the professional services to come in. Yeah, maybe they're still not at the kind of hospitalization stage, but the thing is we want to avoid the hospitalization stage. I feel like there's things that people in those roles can help with. So, even if it's things that aren't directly around the mental illness, like financial stability, like\u2014I don't know, travel, for the kids to school\u2014things that can just lessen some of the other pressures that then kick off the mental illness as well. I think even doing things like that can massively help the person going through the distress, but definitely the family as well. Then, I think there just needs to be access to treatment and services that for people in that stage of their mental illness, because like I said, we don't want them to get to the hospital stage, that's awful.

However, with bipolar schizophrenia, and delusional...these are still words that charities or people don't like using or even I don't think understand as mental health. They will think they understand everything in mental health but as we know, there's a lot more towards that. What more do you think can be done for young people in the community to de-stigmatize those conditions? We know from\u2014I think it's a Bipolar, Australia report, that I think it's 43% of people who committed suicide in 2018, 2019 had bipolar disorder, for example, and then schizophrenia was another 10%. You got more than half of the unfortunate people choosing their in life in Australia, we have two conditions yet, I don't think we know that. What should be done to help destigmatize those two conditions and your mother's conditions? What can be done? What do you think?\n\nLottie O'Dea \nFor me, what I would love to see is, for example, the young people at Satellite just being everywhere. Them sharing their stories, them being invited to share their stories...because that's the best way to understand what those illnesses look like in practice, it's to talk with young people to hear, Yeah, it's really tough but also, this is still my mom at the end of the day, and I love her and there's a million great things about her. I think it's really easy for us to point at someone and be like, Oh, they're schizophrenic, and that equals bad mother. Whereas that's not the case. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI think also, I would love to see more conversations where there's people that have gone through, or are still on their journey with their own mental health challenges, and be talking with people that are in the families of those with mental health challenges, because I feel like sometimes the consumer and the carer conversations happen in parallel, and it's kind of like we're never allowed to meet because, God forbid, we disagree with one another. But I think it's really important that we disagree with one another, especially when it comes to things like involuntary treatment. We should be having a debate about it. You can't come to understand a lot of those tricky and complex concepts or feelings until you hear them from people. I think it's really, you can't really get past just that awareness raising that... You know those old shirts that were like, This is what a feminist looks like? It's kind of like, This is what a young person that has a parent with bipolar looks like, and there's a huge range.

Yeah, I'm thinking exactly the same.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nI was pretty skeptical coming in, but I was like, Whatever, I'll give it a shot. How bad could this go? Really, I think the magic of the creative work is that it means a) you don't have to talk about mental health directly, which, particularly in the younger age groups, it's just not appropriate to. They've already been in lots of deep and meaningful and very serious conversations about this. We don't need to approach it from that view and in fact, it's not really helpful, but the creative activities that we do, they can be about mental health but in terms of, What, am I good at? What superhero would I be if I was a superhero? Yeah, recognizing their strengths and building their own mental resilience, but not necessarily in sitting them down and being like, Okay, so can you give me a list of your top five strengths and weaknesses, and then, show it? I guess, helping them to identify what's going well for them and their own mental well being, but also helping them to identify other things that are going on in their lives as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nAs well as the fact that when you're doing something creative, you're kind of doing it shoulder-to-shoulder with another person, and because of Satellite, it will always be another younger person that has at least one thing in common with you. We see it's really that peer connection that opens people up to those bigger and sometimes heavier conversations as well, but creativity is kind of that gateway to letting those conversations happen. I'm a convert and now, as a facilitator, I'm actually leading some of the creative activities. I've come from my skeptical, scaredness of being a non-creative to recognizing there's a real reason why it works and makes people feel comfortable. It gives them various outlets to communicate whatever they want to communicate. It also just lets people try new things. I think when you've been through traumatic time or just a long standing challenge, sometimes you just move into that Trooper mode where you're like, I just need to get this done. I need to get Mom well. I need to look after Mom. The freedom and the privilege of trying new things is not always something that's there and so this kind of space exists to help with that and that helps you feel good as a person.

That's a gap that we've got at the moment but it's also something that we're wanting to fill. That's why I have the role that I have and I'm supporting Satellite to measure its impact and to communicate its impact. We do things like we bring on universities, such as Monash, to support us in our evaluation of our activities, how we can get better. That sort of evaluation is actually directed by our Youth Advisory Council as well. When we measure our impact, we want it to be useful for talking with government, but we don't want it to be fully driven by their outcome. We bring in our young people to tell us, This is what was meaningful to me, say, peer connection, realizing I'm not all alone. We go, Great. You're the expert in this situation.

        "segment": " \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nYeah, sometimes. I mean, there's been really amazing work in the justice space, in relation to that kind of concept you're talking about. Imagine one person or two people or no, the same person in parallel universes. They are doing that kind of work in justice, for example. If one, let's say, a young person does a does a burglary, and one gets rehabilitative justice, and one gets kind of the typical juvie sort of approach, how does that sort of change their life? Pathways? But I think, partly, it's easier to do that in justice in a way, because there's fairly easy outcomes or bad outcomes to avoid, to look for. Whereas in our space, a) mental health still has that stigma around it. Not that justice doesn't, but I guess we're competing against the fact that, for example, as an under 18-year-old, I never would have been identified as a person that could go to Satellite because my mum would immediately take that away. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nBut also, that we rely quite strongly on the clinical outcomes at the moment to understand the experiences that young people have with this kind of experience. You'll hear phrases like, Young people that have parents or carers with mental illness are twice as likely to have their own mental health challenges. We agree that that's a really important thing but for us, it's also like, That is true, but they are also fiercely resilient people. We would much rather kind of get a sense of how does that experience, as a child in that situation or a young person, make you resilient, prepare you for other challenges that will come along in your life? And then, how does something like Satellite build on that resilience? How does it build a sense of community with other people? Which I guess in short, is having a more strengths based approach to it. The hard part about that is it's harder to measure and it's newer. It's easier to measure when someone's had a hospitalization and then the cost of hospitalization. It's harder to measure the change in resilience for a person and also the kind of monetized benefit of changing someone's resilience.\n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I remember chatting to Addy, who is another person of Satellite, and same thing. I was trying to work out\u2014we know logically, this is a positive thing, right? I understand you have to show stuff for governments and stuff, they throw money at anything now these days without much stuff, but it's annoying because we know how much it would have helped and we know the impact. You know, firsthand, the impact it has.  Just trying to demonstrate that as a study or with numbers, or however you need to do it is very frustrating, because you can almost just have the stories of the kids or the young people who've done it who just talk about it then, in front of a room of politicians, or whoever was doing the funding. To me, personally, that's the evidence you need but it's just really hard, because I kind of stand from your point of view, how hard it must be to try and put that on paper, and how do you actually do that? Whereas, you know\u2014everyone probably logically knows that it's doing all this stuff. Whereas, to say that for the bureaucrats who have appealed on the funding or whatever, it just seems like it's a very tough challenge that you've got to do.\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nIt is. I guess I've seen the other side of it, though, because I've worked within government and trained as an economist, as well so I guess I've seen their perspective. In terms of, you've got a research and development into child cancer, you've got programs like Satellite, but you've also got things like social housing, and all of those things can be preventative policy and they're all kind of competing against one another. One of the things we're doing to try to stand out in that argument, our argument in that environment, is to do what's called a social return on investment.",

I guess, some people get really nervous when things get boiled down to dollar values. Again, my training makes me very nonchalant about that. I'm totally fine with that but I'm fine with it because I guess I know how it's used. It's not about the individual dollars and cents. It's more about demonstrating, Hey, if you do help a young person in this situation, you're helping them in that moment. You're helping them for the rest of their lives, so you help with their resilience. That's good in their immediate short term for getting through what they need to get through, but it can also help with the other challenges that come up in their lives. Now actually, Satellite's at a point where some of the earliest people that went through their programs, they're kind of either in or at the cusp of parenthood themselves, some of them and so, I think now is when we'll start to see some of that generational change as well, where we can help break the cycle. \n\nJoel Klebler  \nYeah, I think that's important because yeah, as a cost from the economy, like if you have someone who can be a better parent than maybe what they were, just makes everything, as you know. It just, as you said, breaks the cycle and it makes life a lot easier for a lot of people. But it must have made you guys feel really good to be specifically mentioned in the Mental Health Royal Commission Report in Victoria, and to get that funding as well, which is fantastic for an organization. Obviously, Rose has put years into it. If not much financial help, but to have that acknowledgement as well, I think first off... What do you hope to do with that funding?

I think yeah, for someone to be so passionate about this, where they're just passionate about that issue, and to put all that 10 years of work into something, with no expectation of any return, but to know that you're actually doing something. Whereas a lot of people say that and whatever it is, she's gone and done it and now to get that rewarded...\n\nLottie O'Dea  \nExactly. It doesn't always happen. There's lots of people out there that do amazing things and don't get that recognition or funding, so it's\u2014yeah, it's incredible to be in that position where both of those things have occurred. Yeah, in terms of going forward, it's really exciting times. We're, in short, expanding the programs that we have, so not just doing more of what we've done before, but we're doing new things as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nWe've always done a couple of regional workshops, because being out in the regions is extremely important to Satellite. We know that the quality and consistency of services can really drop off when you leave metropolitan areas. Now we're doing things like planning a regional roadshow, where we can consistently make our way around particular areas of Victoria to begin with, but we've got a plan for world domination. Then, we're also broadening the kind of things that we can offer as well. \n\nLottie O'Dea  \nFor that sort of 18 to 25, we've always had this thing we call Youth Pathways, which is you can come in to Satellite sometimes to engage with things in relation to your situation, in relation to mental health, but through Youth Pathways, you can also come in to give back in some way or to upskill in other ways. We have things in relation to things like public speaking, in relation to thinking about your career, including things\u2014in fact, you came to one of our workshops in relation to careers or thinking about how you might want to draw on your lived experience and in what you do, and the different shapes that that can take.

I have a little bit of Minnesota kind of background that I can kind of go through, and I think you'll answer all of your questions. So maybe if you'll allow me, I'll just sort of go through that and then and then we'll we'll we'll go from there. So my background is as an institutional investor, which means that in my career I worked at investment banks and the hedge funds Stream, the company that brought us together, their clients, their member paying clients are also institutional investors, private equity and hedge funds. And the meaning of this is that when you're an investor and you want to learn more about your investment, there are a couple of ways that you can go. And one of those ways is to speak with people within the industry like yourself, and that's broadly called the expert network. The main rule is you can't say anything that's secret or confidential. Most people don't have that information, I believe. But, you know, and then the what you get out of it is context and perspective. And you might say that there's lots of other sources of information, and you can talk to the company in their management team, financial reports. \n\n  And those are great, but they're somewhat biased. You know, they could, you know. Highly credible. But, you know, everyone wears the jersey of their company. And then when you talk to Wall Street analysts or these third party research reports and I was a Wall Street analyst, they know a lot about different sectors, but. They are working in the industry, financial services, not in these other industries. So it's helpful to talk to people within within the industry. So. That's expert network. Typically the way it would go is it'll be a one on one consultation call. When I was a portfolio manager and we had an investment team and it was managing a large investment book, if something would happen with one of our positions and we need to find out some information, we, you know, and we used the expert network process, we'd be very pointed and trying to get answers. It's almost like by the time there's something going on your life and you pick up the phone and you speak to a lawyer you're less interested in, you know, the weather and how things are going. You have some questions you need answered. That's a lot of times how the process processes. And as a result, it's fairly tailored. ",

So effectively what I'm saying is, you know, I'm a representative of the client population, not a specific client, but a representative. And I've been doing this for 20 years and I don't work for Stream. I'm watching my own investment management business. Todd Crayton Beach Capital. And so I do a couple of these. And yeah, and so so that's me.

They have different solutions in that category.\n\nExpert:  Currently, I'm not actively working on Cerner products, but my experience has been past experience, which is about two and a half years working on Cerner EMR as well as Cerner population health solutions. Since I'm a psychiatrist, I was actually the primary physician informaticist involved with all behavioral health implementation, optimization, and maintenance of Cerner healthcare technology in Banner.\n\nAnalyst:  That's absolutely fascinating. That's really fascinating. That's really interesting to have those two sides to your career, practicing psychiatry as well as the healthcare IT...\n\nExpert:  Yeah. I think there's two or three people like me in the entire country with that combination. Most informaticists are usually internists or family practice physicians. It's really rare for a psychiatrist to have that additional qualification.\n\nAnalyst:  Yeah. It is interesting. I don't think this is exactly in the way you mean it, but when you talk about psychiatry, I'm just thinking because I've done a couple of other calls earlier today, a lot of that is being made accessible to many, many more through online platforms and so on. I think when you mean healthcare IT, you're talking about the core infrastructure behind.",

There's a digital transformation and real-time information and coordination. There's a little latency in remote surgery. There's just simply getting all those papers that are behind the receptionist's office into digital, all these things. Maybe you could say a little bit more about healthcare technology or your focus there.\n\nExpert:  Yeah. Again, physician informaticists, we have a very specific role in this whole healthcare IT. We are not IT people per se. We don't really deal with all the nitty-gritty of IT. We are not the people who are trying to do networking. We are not the people trying to code software. We are not the people who are trying to implement finance systems and all this stuff. What we do and what I did was we are more of what we call provider-facing IT people. We actually work hand in hand with the providers, the physicians, the nurse practitioners, the nurses who are in the front line providing care. We try to basically help them adopt IT solutions and optimize and teach them how to use them optimally.\n\nExpert:  Again, we are used in a very specific way. A common way a physician informaticist is required in an organization first and foremost is when the organization is trying to implement a EMR, whether it's a new EMR, or it's a replacement EMR, or it's an upgrade from previous EMR. We are the people who would go in and learn the EMR. We call this concept of super users, so people who learn to use the EMR before it's rolled out to the general public and develop a certain amount of expertise and become the experts and become the people who teach other people on how to use the EMR. We would do that. The super users will help with adoption and implementation of the EMR and then go in and try to help people use it optimally because obviously, it's a process. It's a learning process.",

    {
        "segment": "\n\nExpert:  That's the core of what most physician informaticists do, which is what I did for Banner. When I went into Banner, my background actually was in Epic. I've been an Epic user for almost close to, I would say, 12 years. I was not exposed to Cerner at all before I went to Banner. One of the reasons they actually recruited me is because at the time, Banner was actually in the process of buying the University of Arizona health system, which is a big health system by itself, and they were on Epic. They're trying to convert the University of Arizona health system from Epic to Cerner. That's why they felt I was useful that I had the Epic background.\n\nExpert:  They had to just train me in Cerner, and I could be the person who basically knew both the worlds so it would make the transition a little bit easier for them. Again, my primary function, like any informaticist, would be to work on EHR. The other aspect was the population health solution. Population health solutions are something which are separate from the EHR in the sense EHR is mainly just clinical data which is derived from people who create the data in a health system.\n\nExpert:  Population health solutions are information like the registries and the claims analysis and things which are not directly created by the clinicians, but which are a byproduct of what the clinicians record in their EHRs. Those are used to analyze. The whole purpose of population health management solutions is to gather very focused data to focus on certain issues in a big population-wide level.\n\nExpert:  One example would be how do we manage diabetes in a health system which is taking care of, let's see, a population of 50,000 diabetic patients in that area? How do we create a solution which specifically targets monitoring of that specific population? How do you use that data to figure out what works, what doesn't work? How do we create solutions based on that analysis of data? That's more population health management solutions.\n\nExpert:  That was, again, my area of expertise in Banner, was working on those solutions to help, not create, but implement those solutions. Cerner already has this population health management solutions suite. I was one of the physicians on the team which was helping them implement the solutions. By implementation, I mean after they are implemented in the health system, how do I work with physicians on the ground, in the front line to help them figure out how to use those solutions? Is that making sense?\n\nAnalyst:  Yes, that is making sense. That's making a lot of sense, absolutely. On the one hand, part of the goal or challenge is to capture the data so that you can have the data at the population health level so you can form some insights. From that, the law of large numbers and the insights that come from it, you'll have additional actionable solutions or best practices, which then what you do is you work with the providers and make sure they understand how to implement some of these solutions. That becomes part of workflow processes. Did I take a leap there?\n\nExpert:  Yeah. You have a better way of explaining that than I do. Yeah, there's a lot of data everywhere. We talk about big data. There's a lot of data in healthcare, and somebody needs to make sense of that data. That's why we physicians come into play. We might be a little bit better knowing about what data is relevant for a specific purpose.\n\nExpert:  Yeah, getting data is just one part of it, getting to know what that data means and how do you basically use that data meaningfully to analyze and to understand a certain problem and then create actionable solutions. Once the actual solutions are created, how do you implement them on the provider side? The provider actually benefits from it rather than feels inundated. It doesn't feel like it's just one extra piece of work, and it doesn't make any sense to me. \n\nExpert:  Yeah, just making it more meaningful for the provider in understanding what the solution does for them and how they can make it actionable and make it practical in the practice to target real-life issues. This technology's not just technology for the sake of being technology, but it has to do some actionable and useful outcomes for the physicians and the patients.",

[inaudible] its network, its ability to gather data and use that network effect as well. Yeah.\n\nExpert:  My opinion and again, a broad, high-view opinion, basically there are thousands of EMRs and EHRs out there right now. Obviously, Epic is the biggest player right now. Cerner is, I think, the second big, and there are other ones after that. There's eClinicalWorks, and there's a few other works which are the big players in the market. In terms of competition right now, I think the biggest competition for Cerner is Epic. In the last at least five years, there have been several instances where a lot of big organizations have switched from Cerner to Epic. The biggest client which Cerner lost was Mayo Clinic, which was, I think, about two years ago.\n\nExpert:  At least in my opinion, among the big vendors, there are certain areas of strengths and weaknesses, I feel, in my opinion. Now, my primary experience obviously is with Epic and Cerner. I can speak more to them, the differences between them rather than the other vendors. I have some experiences at eClinicalWorks, and I can talk to that as well. These are the primary three vendors I can talk about. I might not be able to talk about other vendors than those three.

That's perfect.\n\nExpert:  I think in terms of the market, the broad market in EMRs or EHRs, I'm going to talk about EHRs first, and then we'll move on to more population health solutions. In terms of the broad market for the EHRs are divided into basically the size of the organization which the EHRs are being implemented for. Obviously, we have the really large health systems like Mayo and Geisinger and Kaiser, Banner. Banner is a pretty large organization as well.\n\nExpert:  We have more medium-sized organizations, and then we have the smaller organizations. Obviously, the large and the medium-sized organizations are mainly buying and using either Epic or Cerner or eClinicalWorks. There's a couple more. That's the market for these vendors. The small practices can't afford these big, expensive vendors.\n\nExpert:  For example, me, I'm a private practice psychiatrist. I can't afford to use any of these vendors because they're super expensive. The only way I can afford to use them is if one of the health systems in the area I practice, they sometimes extend what I call a mini version of the software for certain practitioners in the community who are affiliated with the hospital. That's the only way we can afford this kinds of products at the small practices.\n\nExpert:  I think based on my working with Epic and Cerner and eClinicalWorks, Epic I feel is probably the best EMR. Historically, if you look at the development, Epic was developed as an EMR product while Cerner was actually developed as a billing and revenue management solution. Epic, in my opinion, is a better EMR. Most physicians who I talk to or people who are using the EMR, they like Epic better than Cerner, which I agree because I've seen both these products. Epic, I feel, is more superior in terms of usability. It's more user-friendly. It's more intuitive, and it tends to be more stable than Cerner.",

        "segment": " \n\nExpert:  Cerner, I definitely feel has an edge in terms of population health solutions because they were the first one who came up with that concept. They actually have a little bit better population health management solutions compared to the EMR part. Those are the major differences or I think the big differences between Epic and Cerner, in my opinion. Epic is good as an EHR or EMR, and Cerner is better than Epic for population health management solutions. That's the overall top-level differentiation.\n\nExpert:  Cost-wise, I think Epic is more expensive. One of the reasons when I was working at Banner Health, I was asking the CMIO, Hey, everybody's going to Epic. Why are you guys going from Epic to Cerner? He said one of the big advantage of Cerner was the cost. Cerner tends to be most cost-effective, at least based on my conversation with my CMIO, which is probably true in most cases, actually. People have gravitated to Cerner because of the cost-benefit. People who are willing to spend a lot of money and who don't mind spending a lot of money tend to go to Epic.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I feel that we've covered a lot. Do you think generally the market for Cerner and Epic is going to continue to grow? Do you think that they'll both continue to grow?\n\nExpert:  I think so. One of the things, these vendors are also not only there in USA, but they're also overseas. I think that a lot of them are actually in a lot of European countries now. Again, I don't know the extent of it, but back when I was working in Banner Health where I was more exposed to Cerner, I know they were talking about they were expanding in Europe. I think the market is getting saturated at least in the U.S. because most U.S. hospitals or health systems already have an EMR right now.\n\nExpert:  In terms of the market, the market is not for new EMR adoption. The market, I think, is to switch the competition. How does Epic manage to get Cerner clients to switch to them? How does Cerner get Epic clients to switch to them? For example, you probably heard that Cerner managed to get the big contract with the VAs. A lot of VA facilities are going to switch to Cerner, which is big.\n\nExpert:  Epic is also going in and getting some big clients like Mayo and Geisinger and other places were trying to switch from Cerner to Epic. I don't think that there's many health systems left in the U.S., at least in this country, who don't have EMR. The market is not for new clients. The market is for existing clients to convince them to switch from one product to another.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay, yeah. It is difficult to switch from one product to the other, so probably switching doesn't happen that frequently. It's not a light decision that's made, is it?\n\nExpert:  Yeah, it's super expensive. Yeah, it's not something that happens. Again, it has happened in big cases. Mayo switched, and I think Geisinger switched. There are people who are switching. Banner switched from Epic to Cerner, so those switches are happening. I know the VA is switching. VA had their own EMR, but now the VA and DOD, Department of Defense, they're switching to Cerner. Switches are happening. Again, I don't know how long that's going to go on for.\n\nExpert:  I think there's also definitely a push towards in the overseas market. Again, I don't know the extent of that, but I know both those vendors actually have pretty extensive overseas market as well. The other thing in terms of market is, as I said, Epic has a good EMR or EHR product and Cerner has good population health. Usually, what Epic does, when Epic creates something, it's all Epic-compatible only. I don't know whether that's a business strategy or not. They want to go in. They want to sell their basic EHR platform, but then everything they've developed, it's only compatible with Epic, and that's how it's been.",

For example, if Mayo Clinic decides, Okay, we want to implement a population health solution now, since they are on Epic, I think they are somewhat forced to buy an Epic product. That might be a good marketing strategy for Epic. Now, what Cerner was, Cerner did that initially. They basically created a platform-specific population health management solution.\n\nExpert:  They said, Our population health management solutions will only work with Cerner. They realized they're actually losing a lot of market. What they did was they actually made a platform-agnostic population health management solution, which means what they said was, You don't have to have Cerner. You can have Epic. You can have something else. You can just put our population health solution on top of that, and it'll still work. They're creating this, what we call, platform-agnostic add-on solutions.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay. That's very interesting. All right. This has been a really great conversation. I really appreciate your time. As we're moving towards wrapping up the call, can you think of anything else that we should cover?\n\nExpert:  When we talk about market for these products, we're talking about technology, but unfortunately, I think this company, they probably know it, but the thing they are not able to do very well is support and maintenance. For example, what we know, the people like me in the field, is the main cost of this healthcare technology is not so much the initial buying and implementation, although that's pretty expensive. Epic can cost you upwards of $60 million, $70 million. The maintenance cost is a big cost, and it's a ongoing cost.\n\nExpert:  I think that Epic, again, has a little bit of advantage in that because Epic actually trains enough people, physicians as well as technicians. There's a lot more trained Epic people out there to help on-going maintenance for organizations. I think Cerner lags behind in that respect. Cerner, I think, for whatever reasons, they're very good at selling the product. It's just that they have difficulty with maintenance.",

I think that's where they are a little bit lacking in comparison to Epic, in my opinion.\n\nAnalyst:  More customer training, like more knowing how to use the product and that type thing.\n\nExpert:  Yeah, that also, plus ongoing support. Again, it's probably just a different way of operating. Once you install Epic product in your organization, Epic is there. They're actually with you all the time. Sometimes they're actually too much with you. Sometimes you feel like they're actually coming in your way. They're actually telling you what to do and what not to do, and they're not leaving you alone. They seem sometimes too intrusive, which is one way. That's their orientation, their way of doing business. \n\nExpert:  Cerner seems a little bit more aloof. Once they implement the solution, they let the organization deal with the support and maintenance. The organization might not have the right people with the right knowledge and right training to develop ongoing support and maintenance.

So maybe if you'll allow me, I'll just sort of go through that and then and then we'll we'll we'll go from there. So my background is as an institutional investor, which means that in my career I worked at investment banks and the hedge funds Stream, the company that brought us together, their clients, their member paying clients are also institutional investors, private equity and hedge funds. And the meaning of this is that when you're an investor and you want to learn more about your investment, there are a couple of ways that you can go. And one of those ways is to speak with people within the industry like yourself, and that's broadly called the expert network. The main rule is you can't say anything that's secret or confidential. Most people don't have that information, I believe. But, you know, and then the what you get out of it is context and perspective. And you might say that there's lots of other sources of information, and you can talk to the company in their management team, financial reports. \n\n  And those are great, but they're somewhat biased. You know, they could, you know. Highly credible. But, you know, everyone wears the jersey of their company. And then when you talk to Wall Street analysts or these third party research reports and I was a Wall Street analyst, they know a lot about different sectors, but. They are working in the industry, financial services, not in these other industries. So it's helpful to talk to people within within the industry. So. That's expert network. Typically the way it would go is it'll be a one on one consultation call. When I was a portfolio manager and we had an investment team and it was managing a large investment book, if something would happen with one of our positions and we need to find out some information, we, you know, and we used the expert network process, we'd be very pointed and trying to get answers. It's almost like by the time there's something going on your life and you pick up the phone and you speak to a lawyer you're less interested in, you know, the weather and how things are going.

I've been practicing psychiatry for the last close to 22 years now in various different institutions, in various different settings, in all possible settings. I've been in every setting in psychiatry. That's my primary professional identification. I'm a psychiatrist. That's what I do for a living most of the time.\n\nExpert:  I'm also board-certified in medical informatics, which is a new branch of medicine which deals with healthcare technology. I got board-certified about five years ago. In that capacity, I have also worked in different hospitals and healthcare systems as a physician informaticist.

I was recruited as a physician informaticist for that organization, that health system. I worked for them for about two and a half years. They were basically one of the big Cerner partners. Cerner was actually in partnership with this organization in the sense that all the Cerner products, they would get implemented, tested at Banner before they were actually sold to other Cerner clients.\n\nExpert:  We were the testing grounds for those products, which means we were exposed to a lot of Cerner products all the time, and so was I when I was looking for Banner Health. Specific to the Cerner products I have experience with, I have experience with Cerner Millennium, which was their EMR product. Outside of that, I actually was specifically assigned to work on Cerner population health management solutions. They have different solutions in that category.\n\nExpert:  Currently, I'm not actively working on Cerner products, but my experience has been past experience, which is about two and a half years working on Cerner EMR as well as Cerner population health solutions. Since I'm a psychiatrist, I was actually the primary physician informaticist involved with all behavioral health implementation, optimization, and maintenance of Cerner healthcare technology in Banner.\n\nAnalyst:  That's absolutely fascinating. That's really fascinating. That's really interesting to have those two sides to your career, practicing psychiatry as well as the healthcare IT...\n\nExpert:  Yeah. I think there's two or three people like me in the entire country with that combination. Most informaticists are usually internists or family practice physicians. It's really rare for a psychiatrist to have that additional qualification.\n\nAnalyst:  Yeah. It is interesting. I don't think this is exactly in the way you mean it, but when you talk about psychiatry, I'm just thinking because I've done a couple of other calls earlier today, a lot of that is being made accessible to many, many more through online platforms and so on.

There's a digital transformation and real-time information and coordination. There's a little latency in remote surgery. There's just simply getting all those papers that are behind the receptionist's office into digital, all these things. Maybe you could say a little bit more about healthcare technology or your focus there.\n\nExpert:  Yeah. Again, physician informaticists, we have a very specific role in this whole healthcare IT. We are not IT people per se. We don't really deal with all the nitty-gritty of IT. We are not the people who are trying to do networking. We are not the people trying to code software. We are not the people who are trying to implement finance systems and all this stuff. What we do and what I did was we are more of what we call provider-facing IT people. We actually work hand in hand with the providers, the physicians, the nurse practitioners, the nurses who are in the front line providing care. We try to basically help them adopt IT solutions and optimize and teach them how to use them optimally.\n\nExpert:  Again, we are used in a very specific way. A common way a physician informaticist is required in an organization first and foremost is when the organization is trying to implement a EMR, whether it's a new EMR, or it's a replacement EMR, or it's an upgrade from previous EMR. We are the people who would go in and learn the EMR. We call this concept of super users, so people who learn to use the EMR before it's rolled out to the general public and develop a certain amount of expertise and become the experts and become the people who teach other people on how to use the EMR. We would do that. The super users will help with adoption and implementation of the EMR and then go in and try to help people use it optimally because obviously, it's a process. It's a learning process.",

    {
        "segment": "\n\nExpert:  That's the core of what most physician informaticists do, which is what I did for Banner. When I went into Banner, my background actually was in Epic. I've been an Epic user for almost close to, I would say, 12 years. I was not exposed to Cerner at all before I went to Banner. One of the reasons they actually recruited me is because at the time, Banner was actually in the process of buying the University of Arizona health system, which is a big health system by itself, and they were on Epic. They're trying to convert the University of Arizona health system from Epic to Cerner. That's why they felt I was useful that I had the Epic background.\n\nExpert:  They had to just train me in Cerner, and I could be the person who basically knew both the worlds so it would make the transition a little bit easier for them. Again, my primary function, like any informaticist, would be to work on EHR. The other aspect was the population health solution. Population health solutions are something which are separate from the EHR in the sense EHR is mainly just clinical data which is derived from people who create the data in a health system.\n\nExpert:  Population health solutions are information like the registries and the claims analysis and things which are not directly created by the clinicians, but which are a byproduct of what the clinicians record in their EHRs. Those are used to analyze. The whole purpose of population health management solutions is to gather very focused data to focus on certain issues in a big population-wide level.\n\nExpert:  One example would be how do we manage diabetes in a health system which is taking care of, let's see, a population of 50,000 diabetic patients in that area? How do we create a solution which specifically targets monitoring of that specific population? How do you use that data to figure out what works, what doesn't work? How do we create solutions based on that analysis of data? That's more population health management solutions.\n\nExpert:  That was, again, my area of expertise in Banner, was working on those solutions to help, not create, but implement those solutions. Cerner already has this population health management solutions suite. I was one of the physicians on the team which was helping them implement the solutions. By implementation, I mean after they are implemented in the health system, how do I work with physicians on the ground, in the front line to help them figure out how to use those solutions? Is that making sense?\n\nAnalyst:  Yes, that is making sense. That's making a lot of sense, absolutely. On the one hand, part of the goal or challenge is to capture the data so that you can have the data at the population health level so you can form some insights. From that, the law of large numbers and the insights that come from it, you'll have additional actionable solutions or best practices, which then what you do is you work with the providers and make sure they understand how to implement some of these solutions. That becomes part of workflow processes. Did I take a leap there?\n\nExpert:  Yeah. You have a better way of explaining that than I do. Yeah, there's a lot of data everywhere. We talk about big data. There's a lot of data in healthcare, and somebody needs to make sense of that data. That's why we physicians come into play. We might be a little bit better knowing about what data is relevant for a specific purpose.\n\nExpert:  Yeah, getting data is just one part of it, getting to know what that data means and how do you basically use that data meaningfully to analyze and to understand a certain problem and then create actionable solutions. Once the actual solutions are created, how do you implement them on the provider side? The provider actually benefits from it rather than feels inundated. It doesn't feel like it's just one extra piece of work, and it doesn't make any sense to me. \n\nExpert:  Yeah, just making it more meaningful for the provider in understanding what the solution does for them and how they can make it actionable and make it practical in the practice to target real-life issues. This technology's not just technology for the sake of being technology, but it has to do some actionable and useful outcomes for the physicians and the patients.",

[inaudible] its network, its ability to gather data and use that network effect as well. Yeah.\n\nExpert:  My opinion and again, a broad, high-view opinion, basically there are thousands of EMRs and EHRs out there right now. Obviously, Epic is the biggest player right now. Cerner is, I think, the second big, and there are other ones after that. There's eClinicalWorks, and there's a few other works which are the big players in the market. In terms of competition right now, I think the biggest competition for Cerner is Epic. In the last at least five years, there have been several instances where a lot of big organizations have switched from Cerner to Epic. The biggest client which Cerner lost was Mayo Clinic, which was, I think, about two years ago.\n\nExpert:  At least in my opinion, among the big vendors, there are certain areas of strengths and weaknesses, I feel, in my opinion. Now, my primary experience obviously is with Epic and Cerner. I can speak more to them, the differences between them rather than the other vendors. I have some experiences at eClinicalWorks, and I can talk to that as well. These are the primary three vendors I can talk about. I might not be able to talk about other vendors than those three.

That's perfect.\n\nExpert:  I think in terms of the market, the broad market in EMRs or EHRs, I'm going to talk about EHRs first, and then we'll move on to more population health solutions. In terms of the broad market for the EHRs are divided into basically the size of the organization which the EHRs are being implemented for. Obviously, we have the really large health systems like Mayo and Geisinger and Kaiser, Banner. Banner is a pretty large organization as well.\n\nExpert:  We have more medium-sized organizations, and then we have the smaller organizations. Obviously, the large and the medium-sized organizations are mainly buying and using either Epic or Cerner or eClinicalWorks. There's a couple more. That's the market for these vendors. The small practices can't afford these big, expensive vendors.\n\nExpert:  For example, me, I'm a private practice psychiatrist. I can't afford to use any of these vendors because they're super expensive. The only way I can afford to use them is if one of the health systems in the area I practice, they sometimes extend what I call a mini version of the software for certain practitioners in the community who are affiliated with the hospital. That's the only way we can afford this kinds of products at the small practices.\n\nExpert:  I think based on my working with Epic and Cerner and eClinicalWorks, Epic I feel is probably the best EMR. Historically, if you look at the development, Epic was developed as an EMR product while Cerner was actually developed as a billing and revenue management solution. Epic, in my opinion, is a better EMR. Most physicians who I talk to or people who are using the EMR, they like Epic better than Cerner, which I agree because I've seen both these products. Epic, I feel, is more superior in terms of usability. It's more user-friendly. It's more intuitive, and it tends to be more stable than Cerner.",

        "segment": " \n\nExpert:  Cerner, I definitely feel has an edge in terms of population health solutions because they were the first one who came up with that concept. They actually have a little bit better population health management solutions compared to the EMR part. Those are the major differences or I think the big differences between Epic and Cerner, in my opinion. Epic is good as an EHR or EMR, and Cerner is better than Epic for population health management solutions. That's the overall top-level differentiation.\n\nExpert:  Cost-wise, I think Epic is more expensive. One of the reasons when I was working at Banner Health, I was asking the CMIO, Hey, everybody's going to Epic. Why are you guys going from Epic to Cerner? He said one of the big advantage of Cerner was the cost. Cerner tends to be most cost-effective, at least based on my conversation with my CMIO, which is probably true in most cases, actually. People have gravitated to Cerner because of the cost-benefit. People who are willing to spend a lot of money and who don't mind spending a lot of money tend to go to Epic.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I feel that we've covered a lot. Do you think generally the market for Cerner and Epic is going to continue to grow? Do you think that they'll both continue to grow?\n\nExpert:  I think so. One of the things, these vendors are also not only there in USA, but they're also overseas. I think that a lot of them are actually in a lot of European countries now. Again, I don't know the extent of it, but back when I was working in Banner Health where I was more exposed to Cerner, I know they were talking about they were expanding in Europe. I think the market is getting saturated at least in the U.S. because most U.S. hospitals or health systems already have an EMR right now.\n\nExpert:  In terms of the market, the market is not for new EMR adoption. The market, I think, is to switch the competition. How does Epic manage to get Cerner clients to switch to them? How does Cerner get Epic clients to switch to them? For example, you probably heard that Cerner managed to get the big contract with the VAs. A lot of VA facilities are going to switch to Cerner, which is big.\n\nExpert:  Epic is also going in and getting some big clients like Mayo and Geisinger and other places were trying to switch from Cerner to Epic. I don't think that there's many health systems left in the U.S., at least in this country, who don't have EMR. The market is not for new clients. The market is for existing clients to convince them to switch from one product to another.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay, yeah. It is difficult to switch from one product to the other, so probably switching doesn't happen that frequently. It's not a light decision that's made, is it?\n\nExpert:  Yeah, it's super expensive. Yeah, it's not something that happens. Again, it has happened in big cases. Mayo switched, and I think Geisinger switched. There are people who are switching. Banner switched from Epic to Cerner, so those switches are happening. I know the VA is switching. VA had their own EMR, but now the VA and DOD, Department of Defense, they're switching to Cerner. Switches are happening. Again, I don't know how long that's going to go on for.\n\nExpert:  I think there's also definitely a push towards in the overseas market. Again, I don't know the extent of that, but I know both those vendors actually have pretty extensive overseas market as well. The other thing in terms of market is, as I said, Epic has a good EMR or EHR product and Cerner has good population health. Usually, what Epic does, when Epic creates something, it's all Epic-compatible only. I don't know whether that's a business strategy or not. They want to go in. They want to sell their basic EHR platform, but then everything they've developed, it's only compatible with Epic, and that's how it's been.",

For example, if Mayo Clinic decides, Okay, we want to implement a population health solution now, since they are on Epic, I think they are somewhat forced to buy an Epic product. That might be a good marketing strategy for Epic. Now, what Cerner was, Cerner did that initially. They basically created a platform-specific population health management solution.\n\nExpert:  They said, Our population health management solutions will only work with Cerner. They realized they're actually losing a lot of market. What they did was they actually made a platform-agnostic population health management solution, which means what they said was, You don't have to have Cerner. You can have Epic. You can have something else. You can just put our population health solution on top of that, and it'll still work. They're creating this, what we call, platform-agnostic add-on solutions.\n\nAnalyst:  Okay. That's very interesting. All right. This has been a really great conversation. I really appreciate your time. As we're moving towards wrapping up the call, can you think of anything else that we should cover?\n\nExpert:  When we talk about market for these products, we're talking about technology, but unfortunately, I think this company, they probably know it, but the thing they are not able to do very well is support and maintenance. For example, what we know, the people like me in the field, is the main cost of this healthcare technology is not so much the initial buying and implementation, although that's pretty expensive. Epic can cost you upwards of $60 million, $70 million. The maintenance cost is a big cost, and it's a ongoing cost.\n\nExpert:  I think that Epic, again, has a little bit of advantage in that because Epic actually trains enough people, physicians as well as technicians. There's a lot more trained Epic people out there to help on-going maintenance for organizations. I think Cerner lags behind in that respect. Cerner, I think, for whatever reasons, they're very good at selling the product. It's just that they have difficulty with maintenance.",

There was downtimes, and things weren't working. There was not enough training available. There were not enough trainers available. I think Cerner could do a better job of getting better support. I think that's where they are a little bit lacking in comparison to Epic, in my opinion.\n\nAnalyst:  More customer training, like more knowing how to use the product and that type thing.\n\nExpert:  Yeah, that also, plus ongoing support. Again, it's probably just a different way of operating. Once you install Epic product in your organization, Epic is there. They're actually with you all the time. Sometimes they're actually too much with you. Sometimes you feel like they're actually coming in your way. They're actually telling you what to do and what not to do, and they're not leaving you alone. They seem sometimes too intrusive, which is one way. That's their orientation, their way of doing business. \n\nExpert:  Cerner seems a little bit more aloof. Once they implement the solution, they let the organization deal with the support and maintenance.

If you want to learn more, sell more, Tucker will post...we've got a June free year membership special going on, sales community.com/junefree. \n\n\n\nRandy Seidl  \nDefinitely psyched to have Sean Foster who's a CRO of Anomali. Has only been there since January of this year, so I guess you're well through your 90-day plan. Our topic today is Operationalizing Sales. Really great topic. Our sponsor is Gong. Fantastic Revenue Intelligence platform company. They're a Gold Sponsor of Sales Community. Sean is a great customer and as is going to be giving us some highlights. They started off I'll say, listening in on conversations, have leveraged AI to help for coaching and feedback and now are kind of expanding into a bunch of other go-to-market areas. They had a fantastic virtual event yesterday, called Celebrate. If anybody did not see that, definitely recommend that you check that out. \n\nRandy Seidl  \nUnlike some of the guests, Sean and I only recently met. We actually have known of each other for a long time. Certainly, he has a fantastic reputation, is known for building winning teams, winning sales teams that do well, has always leveraged the ecosystem, has definitely respected relationships with customers and partners. Actually, lives in Tampa, and grew up in Louisiana so by default, is a LSU fan. I try not to hold that against him. As some of you know, I'm a big Alabama fan and Nour's son, Justice is about to go to Georgia so we got a whole lot SEC rivalry going on here. Most importantly, though, he's a great husband and great father of two girls, 10 and 12. Sean, I was exchanging notes with Sue Barsamian the other day, who we both think very highly of, and her summary was, Sean is great.

But yeah, look, I really grew up in technology. I started my first sales job really, back in 1998 and spent a year in Boston, actually, Randy. Worked for a company called Percussion Software. I'd say back then it was really back in the day where...I call it a sweatshop. It was a line of phones and phone books, and you're making those calls and learning the ropes the hard way. I did that for about a year and a half and then moved on to Symantec and got into cybersecurity, in '99. I spent 15 years at Symantec, and really cut my teeth there and moved up through the ranks. Left as the Vice President of the West even though I was in Florida. It's a longer story, and maybe for another episode, but went over to Hewlett Packard. That's where I did meet Sue Barsamian. I went in as Americas leader running security sales. Did that for a year then was moved into the global role and did that for last couple of years until we sold that business to Micro Focus. Decided to get out of the big company and try my hand in and startup world so spend some time as a CRO at Forcepoint. I was at a company called Sienna Group. I was there for a year and we sold that company to ConnectWise and then spent three years at IronNet, took that company public. Then, now I'm at an Anomali and hopefully able to do the same thing here. It's been a good run, had a lot of great experience.

We're only an eight-year-old company, kind of grew up through a threat intelligence side of things, but moved on to be really a big data player. Like I said, rooted in intelligence. We take whatever telemetry you have, we don't care\ufffdwe're vendor agnostic so whether it's Splunk, or any of your EDR vendors, or McAfee, or Symantec, whatever it may be\ufffdand match that up against our global repository, threat intelligence. We have the largest repository of threat intelligence out there, and we show you gaps in your environment, things that you haven't seen before. I'd say three things I always tell customers we do we: amplify visibility in what you already own; we enrich the context that you have to give you insights into that data; then, by doing that, we stop the attackers. We do use the callsign of XDR. We are one of the few XDR players out there. I just got back from RSA and I'd say we're one of several hundreds if not thousands of XDR players out there now.

How about ICP, customers, how do you go to market?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, again, given what I just said, typically, you have to be somewhat of a mature organization or government organization, for that matter. You need to have a SOC and you have a SIEM, typically, to consume something like us. Our ICP here is really 5,000 employees and $1 billion dollars in revenue. That's really a good place to start. We'll make a few exceptions there, certainly on the employee accounts, given if they're a mature security organization. But basically, you need to have somewhat of a mature organization consume something like us, or any XDR vendor for that matter.\n\nDavid Nour  \nAny customers you can mention? Also, how about who do you compete with in that XDR space? Who are the bigger ones you see in your deals?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, well, like I said, I would say the typical or the usual suspects would be Palo Alto or CrowdStrike, or something like that until, like I said, until RSA, and then, it seems like everybody is an XDR these days. It seems like a lot more vendors are out there but those are typically, the players that we see out there in what we're trying to do. But look, again, given what I just said, our ICP, we have over 500 customers globally. They're all household names. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley. I'm giving you guys all East Coast names there.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nGreat names and certainly tough accounts to sell to. \n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, definitely, definitely. Definitely, I'll say the government by name, but a lot of other US government, a lot of overseas government that we do as well in the space. We're very fortunate. Again, we do a lot of reference selling, as well and so great news is that a lot of customers are more than happy to personally give us references. \n\nDavid Nour  \nThat's fantastic. How about size of the organization and tell us a little about the sales team?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, so we're an eight-year-old company, about 300 people company wide. I own probably a third of the organization so I have sales, sales engineers, channel, customer success. Again, about 100-plus, in that group. We have about 35 sellers globally. 20 sales engineers, another 30 or so on customer success, technical support, things along those lines. Pretty decent organization. We're in all three theaters meaning, US, EMEA APJ and growing all three theaters, pretty healthily as well. \n\nDavid Nour  \nThe Sales Community is rich with some really sharp talent and talent seems to be an agenda for every CRO we need.

One of the things that drew me here\ufffdand if you're a security professional, hopefully you can appreciate that\ufffdis, how are we actually going to finally beat the adversaries.

Truly trying to make the world, somewhat of a safer place. As corny as that may sound, it's truly what I came here for, because I felt like the technology was that far ahead and I had some experience of that in my previous life, but I really did admire that technology and what they could do here, as far as to try to put an end to\ufffdor at least to keep up with the adversaries that are out there, now I get ahead.",

How do they get what they want out of their individual contributors? I'm listening for things like, do they have a plan? Do they have a process? Or is it, Hey, go out and just do a bunch of deals and come back to me? Sometimes you can coach that into people that there's more than one way to skin a cat, there's more ways to grow, but I'm always listening for those things in leaders; that they have that mindset that there is a process in place. If everyone's going on that same page where that process is, you can tend to grow and scale a lot faster, which again, in this world, in the startup world that I'm in, it's all about speed and scale.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nTotally. Timothy, thanks so much for asking. He says, Hey, are you guys answering questions? Absolutely. Sorry, I usually mention that in the beginning.

We have Tucker behind the scenes, who does a great job of pulling those up. So, don't feel worried about having to do it in between breaks or whatever. Just pop them up there and we'll kind of pivot over to you accordingly. Anyway, so Sean, back to the title topic, Operationalizing Sales. What are some key pillars in that?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah so, there's really four things I think about, again, growing up through the ranks. First, you got to have talented and engaged employees. It has to be both you have to be both talented and engaged in what you're trying to do that is pillar one. Two is customer and partner loyalty, right? How do you gain loyalty with your customers and then your partners if you are in a partner community? The third thing being operational excellence, right? What are those things that are the must-haves and how do you operationalize it? I think if you do those three things\ufffdthe fourth pillar being business results. The business results will come if you do those first three things really well. That's where I always start. Again, more now\ufffdI'm more speaking to the leadership community out there and working in my organization and what I've seen successful and other big organizations or small organizations...doing those things well, the business results will come and it'll be more predictable and repeatable.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nGreat. Your first one is talented and engaged employees. It may sound silly, but in terms of making sure that they're talented, any one or two nuggets that you do in terms of the interview process or finding out to make sure they're talented? \n\nSean Foster  \nSure, there's a couple of things, right? I'd love to say that I've never had a bad hire, but I'd be lying to you guys. I think everyone has had their moments of bad hires. You just don't know so I always like to get a lot of fingerprints on, especially the key hires out there. I'm using the passive a panel process. If you narrow it down of\ufffdlet's say, you're interviewing 10-15 people for a single job, you narrow it down to a top three, you bring those folks into a panel process, and you have a cross functional group, right? If I'm hiring, let's just say an East Coast leader, I may bring my channel leader, my head of sales ops, my head of HR, product, or SE leader. The four or five of us will watch this person\ufffdor maybe the finalists, two or three people\ufffdgive a presentation, how they present. Did they own the room? Did they that have that presence about them, which is so key? That's hard to kind of get on one-on-one interview sometimes. Then score and have a scorecard. They're somewhat subjective but they're also\ufffdit's some substance in that as well, you actually have a score at the end. That's some way\ufffdagain, if I have a key hire, I want to make sure I have that panel process and that cross functional group within.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nRight? In terms of engagement, I guess it's kind of two parts. Are you face-to-face versus virtual? How do you really get that engagement level?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, great question. I'm going to answer that maybe a couple of different ways. Look, I think, when it comes to employee engagement\ufffdand I don't care if they're Vice President or a BDR\ufffdI think you have to take interest in them personally first, right? That's so important. Do you have an individual development plan for those folks that are in your organization? Do you care about what they do? Do you ask them questions before you get into, Tell me about the deal or Tell me about a forecast? How was your weekend? Right? How was the soccer game this weekend with your kids? Or whatever. I think just taking those extra few minutes. You've shown a personal interest in them and in turn, I feel like if you do that people are more willing to get on board with what you're trying to do. They'll be more engaged in what you're trying to do. That's one way I answer that question, right?",

To be honest, if I was a tech sales leader, I'd definitely take a chance on somebody with your DNA, because I'm sure selling salvaged cars is a heck of a lot harder than selling in any tech thing but you probably just need to get kind of honed up a little bit. I'd also just go online and see about interview best practices. That way you have a good thought process around how to interview, what to do. By the way, in Sales Community, you can do kind of a topic sort on all these topics. As well, feel free to reach out to me if you want to send me a kind of cover resume saying, I saw you on the podcast. You offered to help.

Are they still round or they got purchased by somebody?\n\nSean Foster  \nThey got bought by Stride Rite. Yeah, back in the day.

Sean, one of the comments that I heard years ago that stuck with me is, Every referral is a recommendation. So, back to your customer on channel loyalty comment, if they're not referring you, if they're not making an introduction on your behalf or stepping up and saying, I'm willing to be a reference, you should wonder why is that and are you really delivering value for their business? That comment resonated with me. Thanks for mentioning that. You mentioned\ufffdlove the in-person get together. You had an SKO, about a month or so ago? Give us the highlight. How was that like getting people back together again? What really resonated with you and the team from the SKO?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah. No, it was great. It was in Vegas, so I'll put that out there. We did it off the strip, we did it at the JW Marriott, which was a great property. But like I said, it was a lot of selling, internal selling on my part, to make that go and so when we did get the green light, we only had five weeks to prepare. If any of you guys ever put on and SKO you normally have four to five months that you're preparing and planning and making sure you know what you're going to say. It was like, Hey, we're going, let's make this happen. We all knew we need to get it done but we had half the time\ufffdless than half the time prepare to for it, but it worked out great. \n\nSean Foster  \nAgain, we had a lot of time that was interaction time but we got to work as well. We got to a point where we're doing a lot of training. Again, I'm old school a little bit as well and so we did a lot of work role playing. So, Here are the two sales plays, we're running, right? We're running a sales play; it's going to be a cross sell play with our current customers. We're also going to run a new sales play so let's get in groups cross-functionally... All those teams I mentioned before were there, so sales, SEs, channel, customer success...and we just split everybody up in roundtables and did role playing. We had scenarios on the tables and we spent three, four hours every afternoon doing that and just practicing, right? Then you got to practice your craft and get asked questions that a normal prospect would ask you and be able to respond and be audible ready on that kind of stuff, so it worked out great. I feel a lot more confident. I think the team feels a lot more confident getting out in front of prospects now for being this SKO. \n\nDavid Nour  \nYeah, Seidl and I are big believers in SKO. We've spent several together, and there's nothing as rich as just reconnecting as human beings and kind of seeing each other and getting the team not just excited and rah, rah, but really giving them the tools and the resources to go tackle the next year, so that's great. It's great to see more CROs putting SKOs in person. You also went to RSA last week. How did that go? Give us a highlight from RSA for you and Anomali.",

The booth was packed and it wasn't just packed from of course prospects, things like that but we had a great little area where we were doing demos, and then we had some of our partners, some of the feed vendor partners that we have out there doing some demos as well and it attracted a really big crowd for us. We got a lot of great leads from the show, but we also had a lot of in-person meetings. Over to the side we had a meeting area and so myself, the CEO, and Chief Product Officer and our founder, just had meetings rolling in and out of there. We were inundated there with customer and partner meetings, which was great. Look, I felt like everybody was the same way, even customers who may have not gone in the last five or seven years are like, Hey, I'm going back. I'm going to go see what that's all about. It was great to see people back in person. Again, I've been fortunate in my career since '99, I have always been cybersecurity so for me, it's like a homecoming. You see a lot of people there that you know growing up and hearing some great stories back in the day that maybe you don't remember, so that part of it was really good as well.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nYeah, that's awesome. It was kind of missed by me but a lot of these industry events where there's great CROs like you, we're planning some get togethers going forward. I think it'd be worthwhile. Anyway. All right, we have Luke. Looks like he is your rep at Gong so good that he's on the ball here. He's looking forward to meeting and working with you. Luke already got it in the prep session, Sean said he'd be happy to get with you but obviously, you got to make sure you're adding value, not just getting with them to report the news, but hopefully help him make the news. Anyway, You mentioned customer loyalty, customer retention, etc. Given the current macro-economic climate, how are you thinking about how this is impacting your sales process and go-to-market teams? Do you have a strategy in place? Are you giving your team any recommendations or guidance on how to get in front of these signals to mitigate risk/churn?

I think as business professionals\ufffdI don't want to say sales professionals but business professionals\ufffdwe need to understand what's going out in the world today. We need to understand what's happening with inflation, we need to understand what's happening with the conflict in Ukraine and things along those lines and how that affects not only us, but more important, how does that affect our customers and what are they thinking about? If you think about the economy and where it is right now depending on what vertical you might be calling on or multiple verticals, what are you doing then to potentially create efficiencies for that? Right? How do you potentially save them money or give them time back? A lot of times...again, we'll think about, You got to have this because it's such a cool technology. Well, cool doesn't sell most of the time anyway but cool certainly doesn't sell when it's a downturn economy, right? You needed to be talking business and dollars and cents and be thinking about selling outside of the IT team and selling into more of the CFO or business unit at that point of how you can help them. I think\ufffdwhat my advice to the sales team\ufffdwe've already given it\ufffdis that you guys need to be thinking about this, and how do we potentially, create more efficiencies for our customers or save the money? That's definitely something, Luke, that I would put towards your organization as well, but it's what we're doing here at Anomali.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nAwesome, thanks. From Jesse we have, Sean, congrats on all the success, IronNet, Anomali, etc. Question, should SDRs call direct mobiles (cell numbers)? What are some of your limits where performance and brand are at a conflict? SMS, FaceTime, etc.? I think that at a high level would be your philosophy on texting or cold calling people sales.\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, look, I don't think there's anything against it.  I live in Florida, I like to fish. I like to fish where the fish are and I would say the same thing. I mean, look, if you know someone's mobile phone and can make that call, then make that call. I think, if you get that audience and that person answers, I think you need to be ready\ufffdaudible ready\ufffdabout what you're going to say. It's always better to have a warm introduction, let me start there, should have started there. It's always better to have a warm introduction if you can. But if you can't, look, understand that there's other ways to get to those individuals. I don't think there's anything wrong with that as long as you're being a professional and you're not being a nuisance and calling someone 10 times a day and things like that. I don't think that works. I think that maybe that is old school a little bit when people used to sit by their phones, right? It was their desk phone though, it wasn't their mobile phones. And so, have some respect on that front. [Inaudible]\n\nRandy Seidl  \nThere you go. Jesse says, Luke's awesome. Looks like we have a smiley face from Luke. Hey, Luke, if you want some brownie points with your marketing team, maybe you can post there the Celebrate event link from yesterday. God forbid...anyway. That could be another I might be old school, but... but if you're going to get thousands views on a podcast that you're sponsoring, maybe you want to include the link. Anyway, Jesse says, I know Luke. He's a good dude. I highly recommend him and Gong. Jesse also says something about [Lauren Sermon]. Sorry, not sure what the context is there, Jesse. But, Nour?\n\nDavid Nour  \nYeah. Sean, one of the one of the things\ufffdagain, philosophically, Randy and I both deeply believe in is that we're all products of the advice we take. So, as you've come up through the ranks, and really growing and maturing as a sales leader, are there some examples of sales leaders that you know, you like you respect, that really model the leadership traits, the behaviors, the brand, and how they show up that you admire; you want to try to adapt in your own style?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, I mean, I've been really, really fortunate in my career. I definitely have a couple of sales leader examples. Early on, I would say, and I'll start with a CEO that I had been fortunate to work under. When I was at Symantec, our CEO at the time was John Thompson. Many of you guys know John Thompson out there...\n\nRandy Seidl  \nGreat guy.\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah. He just retired as a Chairman of the Board at Microsoft, but he grew up in Florida. And so, here I am, a new rep in Florida, trying to make my way, and then he would come back to see his father and family and so he would, like a CEO would, come in on Thursday, have a bunch of meetings ready for me to go and I would do my best to do that. That time in the car, going from meeting to meeting, what I really took from him was that I was nobody, right? We were fairly big organization, even back then, but he treated me just like he was treating the CEOs that he was meeting with or the CISOs that he was meeting with. It was no different, right? I felt like a guy in that stature, and that\ufffdcertainly he had a lot of success even before he came to Symantec\ufffdto treat me just every bit with the same amount of respect and dignity that he treated the CEOs we were meeting with, told me a lot about him as a person, but also how I wanted to be, right? I wanted to be that person. If I ever got to that level, I wanted to be able to treat people the the same way as well. That's one. John Thomas had a big impact on me. He's a legend, certainly in this in this field.",

Yeah, worked with him at Symantec. He went on to Zscaler and did great things, took them public. I worked for him again in IronNet. Operationalizing sales is really where that came from and the nuggets that you have to have predictable, repeatable results, and here's a process to get there. That's where I started kind of honing those skills. The other thing that he would say that I love, which I didn't do a great job of growing up in the ranks, was give people the benefit of the doubt. I've been married 22 years, but as you mentioned, I have a 10 and 12-year-old, so it was 10 years there that I didn't have children and I maybe didn't give people the benefit of doubt what was going on their personal life and home life and children. Now that I'm right in the thick of things, I realize just how important that is, and how time-consuming that is, as well. Work is not the most important thing out there, right?

I mean, I don't have\ufffdwords don't describe how I feel about Sue and how great she is and the person thath she is and the leader that she is. I think my respect from her\ufffdand this is, when I met Sue, I was out the door, I was leaving the company. I was at HP, I was going to move on because we had some changes. She asked me to stay and take over this global role. Again, at that point, I'd already been in security for, I don't know, 15-17 years, something like that. Sue had never been in security, and she was going to lead the business unit of security. I was like, What am I going to learn here? She said, Hey, just give me a chance. She worked at it. She was great. By the end of\ufffdit didn't take long at all. I would say three months, maybe six months, she was as fluent as I was, much better probably at the end about how fluent she was in security...she was already always great with partners and customers and things like that but just how fast that she could come up to speed. Security is not an easy thing to learn. It's a big industry. How well she did that...to me, it just, again, inspired me that you're never too old to learn new tricks. You're never too old to learn new things, or new to learn new industries. It gave me kind of a new lease on life as well that I could go on and do different things. That's really kind of inspired me to go into the startup world because it was something I thought that, Hey, it's a young man's game, I'm too old for that. But she really inspired me on that front. Again, I've been very fortunate to have great leaders and I'm sorry for the long answer but it's something that\ufffdit's an important question.\n\nDavid Nour  \nThere was a lot of great nuggets in there. That was awesome. \n\nRandy Seidl  \nYeah, really, really good. I remember Sue, it's kind of like the\ufffdhopefully it's a compliment\ufffdbut it's kind of that iron fist and that silver love. She just has such a nice way about her. Talking about getting to yes, much\ufffdyeah...honestly\ufffdnot that I'm a bull in China shop or maybe I grew up a bit\ufffdbut anyway, she just has such a nice way about her, she can just get 'Yes' from you on anything and then I walk out like, What did I just agree to? Why'd I do it? but yes. Certainly, a fantastic leader, very engaging, very, very helpful for sure. I actually overlapped with Bill also at HP, never had the opportunity with John, but Bill's certainly great. \n\nRandy Seidl  \nWe have a couple other nuggets here. From Lauren, she says, Oh excited to be here. What are you doing to get more women in sales? What are your DEI focuses? This whole topic with women and diversity...what I think, especially around women, is it really needs to go back to the university. You can certainly support women that are in sales now but unfortunately, it's still such a small population. I think a lot of the efforts need to go back to\ufffdnot that everybody has to go to college. If you don't go to college, no problem. Certainly, sales can still be a great career but there's a lot of colleges that have sales programs, so reach out to them. Still, it's so unfortunate that the minority of whatever...hundreds of schools, if there's 1,000 strong schools in the country, the number of them that actually have sales programs\ufffdI looked last year\ufffdit might be like 30, if that.  Why aren't there more? So,to me, that's, I think really the primary fix that really needs to happen. Sean, do you have any other perspectives?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, look, I think, for every one female resume I get, I get 10 male resumes, right? I think, dovetailing what you said, I think that I'd love to encourage\ufffdand again, I have two girls\ufffdto get into sales and get into tech sales, get into security sales, as far as I'm concerned on my end, because I don't think there's just enough women out there that are in sales that would be great at it, right? I'd love to have more on my team, I can tell you that much right now. My HR business partner and I, we talk about that on a regular basis and we're working towards that but again, I'd love to just get more opportunities and have more chances to interview more women in tech, for sure.",

What's your perspective on the importance of\ufffdI guess it used to be called sales ops previously, now RevOps, going forward and the necessity there?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, a great question. Again, given the topic of this podcast, I can't do what I do without having someone measure it, right? What gets measured gets done, let's just be clear about that. You can tell a sales organization or CS organization, Hey, I need you to do XY and Z, but if you're not measuring it, it's not going to happen on a regular basis. I do have a Head of Revenue Operations, Rebecca. She's fantastic. She's come in and really, again, operationalized what I want. Which is, there's things that we're going to measure and one of the pillars that I mentioned earlier, being operational excellence. What are we requiring in salesforce.com? You have to update on a weekly basis, you have to update your next steps to win. Your forecast accuracy, what does that need to look like? How much pipeline do you need to generate on a weekly basis? Well, I can say all those things, but again, if you're not measuring it and putting in lights and so people are seeing that that's something that we're going to work on and getting better on every single week, it falls through the cracks. You have to have that revenue operations partner there, that pulls that together. That's one one thing, Randy. \n\nSean Foster  \nI think the other thing is, the insights, right? We're running so hard these days and even worse, now, in the COVID era with Zoom, I'm sure your calendars like mine, just stacked with meetings back-to-back to back, and you probably catch up on email at 7:00 or 8:00 at night or something like that. You need someone that's looking at the data on a regular basis and bringing that data and saying, Hey, here's some thoughts I have on the data, here's the wins/losses, here's our pipeline metrics, here's things that are driving pockets of brilliance in the organization. You get a real talented person in that organization, they can bring you things that you can start making decisions on and it makes a big difference in the company in a short period of time.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nYeah, awesome.

So, when they're doing their QBRs, or their monthly reviews, how well are we supporting the organization? The way we kind of operationalize it here, if there was something that either was a great nugget or a bad nugget for that matter of, Hey, we're having challenges and here's what it is, but I wasn't able to be on the call or our Product Officer wasn't able to call, that can be quickly sent the recording and they say, Hey, look at minute, 5:57, and we can quickly hear exactly from the customer's point of view, in context, and it's not sugar coated by the team in any other way, about really what's going on. That's how we primarily use Gong here. It's an effective tool for us.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nThat's great. You mentioned customer success, but then you also have Gainsight, right?\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah. Yeah, we use Gainsight. Nick Mehta is a great CEO and I love that guy. A great tool as well in Gainsight. Again, they operationalize everything in customer success through Gainsight. Again, sales, we use salesforce.com and Gainsight, obviously, maps right into that and integrates with it so we bring those two tools together. What I would say in the sales organization and SEO organizations, primarily salesforce.com; customer success, Gainsight; but we marry those two together so we have a seamless operation.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nAwesome. Any other sales tools that you use?\n\n\nSean Foster  \nThose are primarily the ones. I'm sure there's others I'm forgetting. I've been successful in the past with Salesloft when it comes to the BDR function. We have somebody who mentioned that before. The cadences that they do I think, are pretty good. I've used Drift in the past, from the website standpoint, and I think that's a  pretty good tool to do some self-sufficient  type of activity on websites. There's probably no tool I haven't used at some point in time, but those are primarily ones that we use here.\n\nRandy Seidl  \nAwesome. Lauren asked a great question. Are you focusing on working with agencies who focus on these efforts? I have 100 qualified women who are eager and vetted! Would love to help. Lauren, I would just go in Sales Community. I apologize, I don't know all the members but as I said before, if you want a free membership, you can just do salescommunity.com/junefree, and you can just post. I would just post in there and say, Look, I've got 100 qualified women, if anybody's interested, just ping me. We try not to have a lot of solicitations within Sales Community but I think what you mentioned is unique and would be a great way to do it. If you also post that on LinkedIn and tag me, I'd be happy to repost it, which should help with your visibility. Thanks for that, Lauren.\n\nDavid Nour  \nPerfect. Sean, again, going back through your background and what you see and what you've done over the years, I think the three of us could agree sales is absolutely changing, it's evolving. I'd love your perspective on how have you observed that sales function\ufffdtech sales, predominantly, function\ufffdchanging, evolving? Let's talk about some of those nuances.\n\nSean Foster  \nYeah, well, there's a couple of things, right? There's time. There's change over time but then I think COVID is another huge thing which changed, right? Let's talk about the first one. Over time, I'll say over the last 10 years, David, that you've sold a lot on relationship and a lot of knowing people and You can do a steak dinner, a round of golf, or whatever it may be, and that went a long way. Typically, all things were equal. There\ufffdre so many more people now involved in the sales process, where that may have just been a CIO or CISO, or somebody like that, that you were selling to and can pretty much make some of those decisions on their own. Now, that just doesn't happen anymore. There\ufffdre so many more people that have to be part of the buying process, whether it's a CFO, or it's a purchasing agent, or contract specialist. Those types of things don't work anymore. You truly have to show value. Your product truly has to show value and then create value for the organization. I think that's how it's changed. If you can't articulate\ufffdif you're a seller and you can articulate the value of your solution and how you've helped other companies out there...you can do all the glad-handing, golf rounds in the world, it's never going to change. You're never going to get that deal, you're going to end up having a golf buddy. I think that's how it's changed maybe in the last 10 years.",

You still have to show value, of course, but when COVID hit, I was at a different organization. We said, Hey, everyone is inside sales now. I don't care how long you've been doing this, or how much ego you have, you're an inside seller. We're going to act as inside sellers and we're going to function that way. We learned pretty quick, from a sales standpoint, or a product standpoint, is that we had to do everything remote. You got to be able to make sure that you can do it remotely. It was a great test for the company but we pulled it off, right? We had to move quick, and some people didn't make that journey. Some people said, Hey, I don't want to do this. I don't want to make 100 calls a day. It's not who I am. I'm a relationship seller. That's fine but things had to change during COVID.

I always say, Are you lucky or are you good in sales? Right? How do you know? There's so many tools now that can help you with that because it used to be that you just go out and go on some sales calls with an individual and you can figure out in a couple of days, is this person lucky? Are they good? Now, there's a lot of metrics that can help you with that, right? Like I said, there's Salesforce metrics, there's pipeline metrics, there's the Gainsight, there's things like that, that can show you. I think our role as CROs have been much more\ufffdyou can be much more of an operator than you once were before. Still nothing better than getting out in the field and trust me on that, I feel I miss it. But I think that's where this role has evolved. You still need to know though. Somebody can have a great year, but again were they lucky or were they good? Do they have a process?\n\nRandy Seidl  \nAbsolutely. Dick Egan of EMC used to say, The harder you work, the luckier you get. I'd say I'd rather be lucky than good but anyway... Speaking of EMC, I don't know if anybody ever told you or you came across Gregg Ambulos, but just sitting here like, Geez, I think I'm talking to his twin. He runs channels, was EMC, now Dell EMC, but I'm sitting here like, Oh my gosh. Anyway.\n\nSean Foster  \nHope that's a compliment (chuckles).\n\nRandy Seidl  \nYeah, that's a compliment about you. I'll leave it at that. Anyway, time flies when you are having fun so thanks so much, Sean. Really appreciate it. You've been a fantastic guest. Nour, as always, honored to co-host with you.

Now he's got his hands in a bunch of different things in terms of boards, investing, but he's also in the sales excellence practice at Gartner so he'll certainly have some fantastic perspectives. The title for his session is Selling and Leadership During Tough Economic Times. Not sure if we're allowed to categorize inflation, recession, whatever. Anyway, that'll certainly be a great session as well. \n\nRandy Seidl  \nTucker, thanks so much for your help behind the scenes here. As always, we get this reposted across all the different social mediums so if you have friends that missed it or you want to go back and check it out, certainly feel free.
